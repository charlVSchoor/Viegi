South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the inflation outlook has been dominated by the further decline in international oil prices, from around US dollar 75 per barrel in late November to current levels of around US dollar 46 per barrel.   Domestic petrol prices declined by almost R2 per litre over the period (and over R3 per litre since August), and a further sizeable decrease is expected in February.   This decline in domestic prices occurred despite some offsetting effects from a further depreciation of the rand against the US dollar. The near-term inflation outlook has therefore changed significantly, but the favourable impact of these developments on both inflation and growth in the longer term will depend on the persistence of the oil price decline.   Even a moderate increase in oil prices going forward will reverse the favourable inflation trajectory, and the inflation and growth benefits, while welcome, are expected to be temporary.   At the same time, the impact of load shedding and a deterioration of the global 1 growth outlook are likely to offset some of the positive impacts of the lower petrol price on domestic growth. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas maintained its recent downward trend and measured 5,8 per cent and 5,3 per cent in November and December respectively, down from its recent peak of 6,6 per cent in May and June 2014.   This trend reflected continued moderation in food and petrol prices.   Food price inflation measured 7,4 per cent in December, down from 7,7 per cent in November, while petrol prices declined by 5,5 per cent.   By contrast, core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, remained near the upper end of the inflation target range, but moderated to 5,7 per cent in December from 5,8 per cent previously. Headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods was also favourably impacted by declining oil and agricultural crop prices, and measured 6,5 per cent and 5,8 per cent in November and December respectively compared with 6,9 per cent and 6,7 per cent in the preceding two months. The decline in international oil prices has prompted a downward revision of the oil price assumption in the Bank’s forecasting model, with a significant impact on the near-term inflation forecast.   The longer term impact will be dependent on the persistence of these lower prices, which have been a reaction to global supply and demand factors as well as a change in the behavior of key oil producers.   With supply still plentiful and global growth prospects remaining relatively subdued, lower oil 2 prices are expected to persist for some time.   However, our forecast makes provision for a moderate increase over the next two years. Having averaged 6,1 per cent in 2014, inflation is now expected to average 3,8 per cent in 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 5,3 per cent, and to reach a low of 3,5 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with 5,1 per cent previously.   The steep decline in 2015, however, produces a strong base effect in 2016, and, when combined with a slightly higher oil price assumption and a depreciated nominal effective exchange rate of the rand, results in an average inflation forecast of 5,4 per cent for the year (5,5 per cent previously), and 5,3 per cent in the final quarter. The impact on core inflation is far less pronounced.   Core inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent and 5,1 per cent in 2015 and 2016 respectively, from 5,7 per cent and 5,3 per cent previously.   The peak is expected at 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University moderated from 6,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2014 to 5,8 per cent in the final quarter.   Analysts and trade unionists revised their forecasts for 2015 downwards by 0,3 percentage points to 5,4 per cent and 5,9 per cent respectively, while the forecasts of business people were 0,2 percentage points lower at 6,2 per cent.   Forecasts for 2016 are unchanged for the latter category, but both analysts and trade unionists expect a 0,1 percentage point increase in 2016 relative to 2015.   While this downward revision is a welcome development, it is too early to assess whether or not this represents the start of a 3 sustained downward trend.   At these levels, expectations still remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. According to the Reuters poll of economic analysts conducted in January, the median inflation expectation is 5,0 per cent in 2015, rising to 5,5 per cent in 2016.   The low point of the inflation trend is expected in the second quarter, with the median at 4,6 per cent, but with expectations ranging from 3,4 per cent to 5,9 per cent.   Inflation expectations as reflected in inflation linked bonds have been volatile, having increased in response to the weaker exchange rate in November, but since mid- December have exhibited a steep decline.   Both the 5-year and 10-year break-even rates have declined to levels below 5,5 per cent. The global economic growth outlook remains mixed, despite a strong performance by the US economy, lower international oil prices and the quantitative easing announced by the ECB.   The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 5,0 per cent in the third quarter of 2014, the fastest quarterly growth since 2003.   The unemployment rate continued to decline as job creation accelerated, and lower oil prices have provided a boost to consumption expenditure.   Growth in the UK also remains robust, despite slower fourth quarter growth.   By contrast, growth prospects in a number of other advanced economies have deteriorated, with Japan in a technical recession and the Eurozone remaining weak amid fears of deflation. Lower oil and other commodity prices have had divergent implications for growth forecasts of different emerging market economies.   Deteriorating prospects in some emerging markets contributed to the lowering of the IMF’s 2015 global growth 4 forecast by 0,3 percentage points to 3,5 per cent, with notable downward revisions to Brazil, China, Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia.   Growth in China is now expected to moderate to 6,8 per cent from 7,4 per cent in 2014 as the economy continues to rebalance towards domestic consumption and reduce vulnerabilities in its banking system.   Although Africa remains one of the high-growth regions, weaker commodity prices pose a risk to the outlook. The impact of lower oil prices on global inflation is expected to influence monetary policy responses.   Although the US Fed has indicated that policy rates are still likely to rise from around the middle of the year, recent market expectations are pricing in a later start, as inflation remains low.   Furthermore, Fed guidance suggests that normalisation, when it does begin, is likely to be at a gradual pace.   Whereas the UK had been expected to be the first of the advanced economies to begin raising policy rates in the first half of this year, the lower expected inflation trajectory has changed expectations to later in 2015 or early 2016. While the UK and US contemplate monetary tightening, the ECB has embarked on open-ended quantitative easing, amid risks of deflation, and the slowdown in Japan is also expected to result in a resumption of asset purchases.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, monetary policy rates have been lowered in Canada, China, Denmark, Egypt, India, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, while policy has been tightened in Brazil, Nigeria, and Russia. Global foreign exchange market volatility increased in recent weeks in anticipation of quantitative easing by the ECB; possible risks to the euro from the Greek elections; 5 the ending of the Swiss franc floor against the euro; and changing expectations regarding the timing and pace of US policy normalisation.   Since the previous MPC meeting, the euro depreciated by about 10 per cent against the US dollar.   Over the same period, the rand depreciated by 5 per cent against the US dollar and by 1,5 per cent against the pound sterling, but appreciated by about 6 per cent against the euro.   Given the relatively high weight of the euro in the trade-weighted index, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand depreciated by 0,6 per cent. Market perceptions of a possible delay in US normalisation, coupled with the ECB action, has changed global market risk sentiment and improved the near-term prospects for capital flows to emerging markets.   This follows a generalised sell-off in December.   These flows are likely to be highly volatile and expected to be more discriminating than in the past.   The spill-over effects of the ECB quantitative easing on the rand are therefore not expected to be as pronounced as was the case with the US quantitative easing. Capital flows to South Africa have been in line with these global developments.   During December, non-resident net sales of bonds and equities amounted to R17,9 billion and R8,2 billion respectively.   This trend reversed in late December, as portfolio flows to emerging markets resumed, and in the first three weeks of January, non-residents were net purchasers of bonds to the value of R5,8 billion, while net equity sales amounted to R1,5 billion. The rand has also been affected by domestic factors, including the disappointing domestic growth and current account deficit outcomes, as well as a resumption of 6 load shedding by Eskom.   The rand is expected to remain sensitive to developments on the current account of the balance of payments, which measured 6,0 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2014.   Non-oil commodity prices have been on a declining trend since around 2011, so the recent decline in the oil price represents a positive terms of trade shock that could have a favourable impact on the current account.   However, this effect is expected to be limited, in part due to the possible constraining effects of load-shedding on exports. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued.   Despite an expected growth acceleration in the fourth quarter of 2014 following an annualised growth rate of 1,4 per cent in the previous quarter, growth for 2014 is expected to average 1,4 per cent, with at least one percentage point lost to work stoppages.   The Bank’s forecast for growth in 2015 has been revised down from 2,5 per cent to 2,2 per cent, and that for 2016 from 2,9 per cent to 2,4 per cent.   This forecast attempts to take account of electricity supply disruptions which more than offset the positive growth impact of lower oil prices.   The Bank’s composite business cycle indicator has followed a moderate downward trend in the past months, confirming the subdued outlook.   More positively, the RMB/BER business confidence index returned to net positive levels for the first time since the first quarter of 2013, when it increased by 5 points to 51 index points in the fourth quarter of 2014. The mining sector, which expanded output by 6,2 per cent on a three-month-to- three-month basis in November, is expected to contribute positively to fourth quarter growth, despite the 1,2 per cent month-to-month contraction in that month.   Nevertheless, platinum output still remains below pre-strike levels, and the sector is 7 likely to face headwinds in 2015 from lower commodity prices and electricity supply uncertainty.   The outlook for the manufacturing sector, which contracted for three consecutive quarters, is looking more positive following the resolution of the strikes in the sector, with a three-month-to-three-month increase in November of 4,1 per cent.   However, output declined by 2,1 per cent on an month-to-month basis due to electricity supply disruptions.   The Kagiso PMI declined to 50,2 index points in December from 53,3 points in November, indicating an expectation of positive, but subdued growth in the sector. Although gross fixed capital formation was the largest contributor to GDP growth in the third quarter of 2014, the trend remains weak.   Growth in gross fixed capital formation measured 2,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2014 following two consecutive quarters of contraction.   While the private sector investment reversed its negative trend in the previous two quarters, at 0,7 per cent it remains extremely low. The weak growth and investment trends are reflected in the slow rate of formal sector employment creation.   According to the Quarterly Employment Survey of Statistics South Africa, employment levels decreased by 5,9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2014, mainly due to the termination of temporary employment contracts related to the general elections in the second quarter.   This contributed to the annualised 20,8 per cent decline in public sector employment, while private sector employment over the quarter increased by 0,1 per cent or 2,000 jobs.   Compared with a year ago, employment increased by 1,0 per cent, predominantly in the public sector. 8 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households remains weak, despite a slight acceleration in the third quarter of 2014 to 1,3 per cent from 1,1 per cent in the previous quarter.   However, expenditure on durable goods increased at an annualised rate of 6,2 per cent, and reflected in stronger new vehicle sales.   Retail trade sales improved in November with a month-to-month increase of 1,5 per cent, and year-on-year by 2,6 per cent.   Consumption expenditure is expected to get some boost from lower petrol prices.   Consumer confidence, while still relatively low, also showed a slight improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014, having increased to a level of zero from the previous level of -1. Trends in bank credit extension to the private sector continue to reflect tight conditions for households while credit to the corporate sector remains buoyant.   Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,7 per cent in November.   However, growth in loans to households, which has been steadily declining over the year, reached a low of 3,6 per cent in November, while that to the corporate sector recorded 15,2 per cent.   Growth in general loans to the private sector, mainly unsecured lending, remains weak, despite an increase to 2,9 per cent in November; growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance moderated further to 6,1 per cent; while mortgage advances continued to grow below 3 per cent in line with the subdued housing market.   These trends are assessed to be a reflection of both continued tight credit conditions and weak demand, as household indebtedness remains high. Wage settlements indicate a continuation of above-inflation wage and salary increases.   According to Stats SA data, nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector increased at a year-on-year rate of 6,9 per cent in the 9 third quarter of 2014.   With labour productivity growth of 0,3 per cent, growth in nominal unit labour costs amounted to 6,7 per cent in the quarter.   According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications the average settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 8,1 per cent in 2014, compared with 7,9 per cent in 2013.   The outcome of the public sector wage settlement, due to be implemented in April, is expected to have an important bearing on the general trend of wage settlements in the economy in 2015. Food prices remain a major source of inflation pressure with increases still in excess of the headline inflation rates.   However, the moderation observed in recent months is expected to continue, despite the reversal of the downward trend in manufactured food prices at the producer level since October.   Agricultural food price inflation remains low, having measured 1,4 per cent in December, with a bumper maize crop expected this year.   Global food prices have continued to decline, with the Food and Agricultural Organisation food price index declining by 3,7 per cent in 2014. The inflation landscape has changed significantly in recent weeks, but the outlook for international oil prices is highly uncertain.   Unless a persistent oil price decline is assumed, the impact on the inflation trajectory will dissipate over time.   The key issue for the MPC is the extent to which second round effects become evident and lead to a more generalised inflation moderation over the forecast period, and to a further and sustained decline in inflation expectations.   The forecast of core inflation at this stage indicates a relatively muted decline in underlying inflation. The rand exchange rate against the US dollar remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook and is vulnerable to the timing and pace of US policy normalisation, despite the partial offset from a weaker euro.   Further depreciation of the rand against the US 10 dollar could also erode the positive benefits of lower oil prices on inflation.   The slow pace of contraction of the current account will continue to keep the rand sensitive to both domestic and external factors. Along with the exchange rate, wage and salary increases in excess of inflation and productivity growth remain an upside risk to the inflation outlook.   Unless nominal wage increases moderate in the lower inflation environment, the beneficial effects of the depreciated currency on competitiveness will be eroded.   The MPC views the overall risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced, with no evidence of excess demand pressures on inflation. Notwithstanding a downward revision to the growth forecast, the risks are assessed to be moderately on the downside.   This is due to the likely protracted nature of the electricity supply constraints, and their consequences for domestic output as well as for business and consumer confidence.   However, given the supply side nature of this constraint, the impact of further monetary policy accommodation on growth is likely to be limited, in the absence of progress being made in the alleviation of electricity constraints.   In addition, the implementation of structural reforms is necessary to raise potential growth. For some time we have emphasised that we are in a process of interest rate normalisation.   The lower inflation path gives us some room to pause in this process, particularly against the backdrop of continued weakness in the economy.   The MPC has therefore unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,75 per cent per annum. 11 The MPC is aware that the moderation in inflation could raise expectations of lower interest rates.   The MPC is of the view that the bar for further accommodation remains high and would require a sustained decline in the inflation rate and inflation expectations. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the near-term inflation outlook has deteriorated with the partial reversal of the recent petrol price declines, emerging upside pressures on food and possible further electricity tariff increases.   The rand exchange rate has depreciated further, adding to upside inflation risks, against the backdrop of the expected, but uncertain, tightening of US monetary policy.   The domestic economy, however, remains weak amid electricity supply constraints, and relatively subdued domestic demand. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,4 per cent and 3,9 per cent in January and February respectively.   The lower trend in inflation was mainly due to lower petrol prices, but recent oil price and exchange rate developments suggest that this is likely to be the low point for the medium term inflation trajectory.   The February outcome was marginally above market consensus and the Bank’s forecast of 3,8 per cent, partly as a result of higher than expected health insurance price inflation of 9,6 per cent. 1 Petrol prices declined by 26,6 per cent in February, while food price inflation measured 6,5 per cent in February, down from 6,6 per cent in January.   By contrast, core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, remained near the upper end of the inflation target range, having measured 5,8 per cent in both January and February. The favourable impact of the lower oil price was also evident in the headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods, which measured 3,5 per cent and 2,6 per cent in January and February respectively compared with 6,5 per cent and 5,8 per cent in the preceding two months.   The downward trend is also expected to reverse in the face of adverse fuel and food price developments. According to the Bank’s latest forecasts, inflation is now expected to average 4,8 per cent in 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 3,8 per cent.   A first quarter average of 4,2 per cent is now projected as the low point, compared with 3,5 per cent previously.   The strong base effects in the first quarter of 2016 are expected to result in a temporary one-quarter breach of the inflation target during that quarter, at 6,7 per cent, with the average for the year expected to measure 5,9 per cent compared with 5,4 per cent previously.   Inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of the year, compared with the previous forecast of 5,3 per cent. The forecast for core inflation is more or less unchanged at 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2015 and 2016 respectively, the latter up marginally from 5,1 per cent.   The peak is still expected at 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015.   The deterioration in the headline forecast is due to an expected acceleration in food price inflation, and 2 the impact of the higher fuel and Road Accident Fund levies on the petrol price, due to be implemented in April.   This is in addition to the current under-recovery on the petrol price.   The international oil price assumption remains unchanged from the previous meeting, with a moderate increase over the next two years.   The electricity price assumption is also unchanged, with increases of 11,6 per cent assumed from July 2015 and July 2016.   However, there is a high possibility of significant further electricity tariff increases. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey conducted in the first quarter of 2015, improved for all respondents for 2015, but returned to levels around the upper end of the target range in the next two years.   On average, expectations for 2015 declined from 5,8 per cent to 5,4 per cent, with a one percentage point decline in the expectations of analysts to 4,4 per cent, and a 0,2 percentage point decline in expectations of business people and trade union officials to 6,0 per cent and 5,7 per cent respectively.   However, expectations for 2016 and 2017 are higher, with expectations of the categories of respondents ranging between 5,6 per cent and 6,2 per cent in 2016, and between 5,3 per cent and 6,3 per cent in 2017. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, with a moderate slowdown in the US and China, and an improvement in the outlook and performance of the euro area and Japan.   The US grew at a rate of 2,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from 5,0 per cent in the previous quarter, as the stronger dollar impacted negatively on export growth and investment.   Nevertheless, the longer term growth outlook remains positive.   By contrast, the weaker euro and accommodative ECB monetary 3 policy have contributed to improved growth prospects in the region, particularly in the core countries.   In the fourth quarter of 2014, euro area growth surprised on the upside at 1,3 per cent and ECB forecasts for 2015 have been revised upwards by 0,5 percentage points to 1,5 per cent.   The Japanese economy emerged from two quarters of negative growth, recording a growth rate of 1,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. The larger emerging markets continued to be a drag on global growth.   China’s economic prospects remain relatively subdued with most domestic demand indicators weakening since the beginning of the year.   Consensus forecasts are for both Russia and Brazil to record negative growth rates in 2015.   The outlook for the Indian economy, by contrast, is more positive. Global financial markets continue to be dominated by changing expectations of the timing and speed of normalisation of US monetary policy.   Favourable labour market data in the past weeks in the US resulted in a strong appreciation of the US dollar against most currencies, as expectations of the start of policy tightening were brought forward.   However, these expectations were tempered following the March FOMC meeting where the growth and inflation forecasts were downgraded.   Uncertainty persists regarding the timing of the first interest rate increase.   The FOMC has not only re-emphasised the gradual nature of the expected path of interest rates, but the members’ individual expectations of the interest rate path were also revised down significantly.   In response to this guidance, the dollar weakened somewhat against most currencies. 4 While the US prepares to tighten monetary policy, the global trend has generally been towards policy easing or maintaining an accommodative bias.   Both Japan and the euro area have continued with their quantitative easing while a number of countries have eased their policy further, amid benign inflation pressures and concerns about deflation in some countries. The volatile global trends were reflected in the high degree of volatility in the rand/dollar exchange rate.   Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand depreciated by about two per cent against the US dollar, but traded in a wide band of around R11,27 and R12,52 against the dollar, with a marked recovery after the recent FOMC meeting.   Over the same period, the rand was more or less unchanged against the euro.   On a trade-weighted basis, the rand depreciated by 0,7 per cent.   Although the rand movement reflected US dollar strength to a large degree, the rand was also negatively impacted by domestic factors including the weak January trade data, and issues relating to Eskom and the domestic growth outlook. The rand is expected to remain volatile while uncertainty regarding the outlook for US monetary policy persists.   The commencement of US interest rate increases, when it happens, is expected to put the currency under pressure.   The rand is also expected to remain sensitive to developments on the current account of the balance of payments.   The marked narrowing of the trade account in the fourth quarter, reflective of higher export volumes and lower import volumes, contributed to the narrowing of the deficit to 5,1 per cent of GDP in that quarter, and to 5,4 per cent for the year.   At this stage it is unclear whether or not this represents the beginning of a sustained compression of the current account, after a long period of real exchange 5 rate depreciation.   While lower international oil prices are expected to continue to impact favourably on the import bill, as oil imports account for just under 20 per cent of merchandise imports, the wide trade deficit in January, should it persist, suggests that the adjustment may remain slow. Although the current account deficit to date has been relatively comfortably financed, the global capital flow environment is increasingly challenging, particularly against the backdrop of expected increases in US interest rates.   During the fourth quarter of 2014, the deficit was financed primarily through flows into the banking sector.   Year to date, net sales of bonds and equities by non-residents as reported by the exchanges, suggest that net portfolio flows on the financial account of the balance of payments in the first quarter may be negative for the second consecutive quarter. The outlook for the domestic economy remains overshadowed by the electricity supply constraint, which appears to have had an adverse effect on recent economic activity.   This constraint is likely to persist for some time, and has resulted in a downward revision of short-term potential output to between 2,0 and 2,5 per cent.   Nevertheless, some improvement on the 2014 growth rate of 1,5 per cent is expected in 2015, in the absence of protracted work stoppages.   The Bank’s growth forecast for 2015 is unchanged at 2,2 per cent, and marginally lower at 2,3 per cent for 2016.   The Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity, which had followed a moderately declining trend in 2014, also suggests a continuation of the sluggish growth outlook. 6 Underlying this outlook is the continued weakness in growth of gross fixed capital formation, which contracted by 0,4 per cent during 2014, with private sector fixed investment contracting by 3,4 per cent, despite some recovery in the final quarter of the year.   The main contribution to fixed capital formation came from general government, which accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total.   With business confidence subdued, and amid binding electricity supply constraints, the prospects for a meaningful acceleration remain weak. Initial high frequency data for 2015 are also a cause for concern, should the trends persist.   Both real mining and manufacturing output contracted on a month-on-month basis in January; the Kagiso PMI declined sharply to below the neutral 50 level in February; the RMB/BER business confidence index declined to below the neutral 50 level in the first quarter of 2015 to 49 points, with the decline most marked in the manufacturing sector; and the building sector also shows signs of slowing, with both buildings completed and new plans passed declining, along with lower confidence in the sector, particularly with respect to residential construction. Against this backdrop, employment growth has stagnated and likely to remain low: according to the Quarterly Employment Statistics of Statistics South Africa, formal sector non-agricultural employment contracted by 0,2 per cent over four quarters in the final quarter of 2014, with growth in public sector employment more than offset by job-shedding in the private sector. Growth in final consumption expenditure by households increased marginally to an annualised quarterly rate of 1,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014, and measured 1,4 per cent over the year.   Both retail trade and wholesale trade sales declined on a 7 month-to-month basis in January, and the outlook remains uncertain as the potential boost to consumption from lower petrol prices has been partially reversed.   However, confidence of retailers, particularly of durable goods, remains relatively high.   High debt levels, low employment growth and continued tight credit conditions are likely to constrain consumption expenditure growth in the absence of strong increases in real disposable incomes or strong positive wealth effects. Fiscal policy is set to continue on its consolidation path.   As outlined in the recent Budget Review, the projected deficit for both 2014/15 and 2015/16 is estimated at 3,9 per cent of GDP, despite lower GDP growth forecasts, and is expected to narrow to 2,5 per cent of GDP by 2017/18.   This is envisaged to be achieved through a combination of lower expenditure compared with the 2014 budget estimate and higher tax revenues.   This is expected to exert a moderate constraining effect on household consumption expenditure growth. Trends in bank credit extension to the private sector have remained relatively unchanged, with highly divergent patterns in loans granted to the corporate and household sectors.   While growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,3 per cent in January, credit extended to corporates increased by 14,3 per cent while that to households increased by 3,5 per cent.   Growth across all the main categories of credit extension to households has remained subdued in recent months, despite a slight increase in unsecured lending off a low base.   Both mortgage credit extension and instalment credit and leasing finance reflected slow growth in housing and motor vehicle sales.   Commercial mortgages, by contrast, experienced buoyant growth. 8 The recent higher trend in wage settlements has the potential to put further upside pressure on inflation.   Nominal remuneration per worker over four quarters increased by 7,7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014, and, after accounting for changes in labour productivity, resulted in a unit labour cost increase of 6,2 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent in the previous quarter.   The Andrew Levy Employment Publications survey shows that during 2014, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 8,1 per cent, compared with 7,9 per cent in 2013.   The public sector wage settlement is still not agreed, and the outcome is expected to have an important bearing on the general trend of wage settlements in the economy in 2015. The recent downward trend in consumer food price inflation is forecast to be reversed in the coming months, following the severe drought in some of the maize producing areas of the country.   With drastically reduced maize crop estimates, South Africa is expected to become a net importer of maize during the year, and spot prices have moved closer to import parity.   The spot price of white maize, for example, has increased by around 30 per cent since the beginning of the year, reinforced by a depreciating currency and despite moderating global prices.   Meat prices have also remained elevated. International oil prices have been relatively volatile but at vastly lower levels than those prevailing for much of 2014.   Having reached a low of around US dollar 45 per barrel in January, Brent crude oil prices increased to around US dollar 62 per barrel at the end of February, before declining to current levels of around US dollar 57 per barrel.   The partial 9 recovery in the international oil price, in conjunction with the recent depreciation of the rand against the US dollar, and the impending fuel and RAF levies, will have reversed a large part of the favourable impact on domestic petrol prices, which had declined by about R4 per litre between August 2014 and February 2015. The respite to the headline inflation outlook from lower international oil prices appears to have been short-lived.   However, the expected breach of the target range in 2016 is likely to be temporary and the main drivers of the deterioration of the inflation forecast are exogenous.   While the MPC will look through these developments, the Committee remains concerned about the possible impact on inflation expectations which remain at the upper end of the target range over the longer term. The rand exchange rate continues to be the main upside risk to the inflation outlook, and remains highly vulnerable to the timing and pace of US monetary policy normalisation.   The extent to which US rate increases are priced into the exchange rate remains uncertain.   While the weaker euro has provided some offset, and therefore a more moderate depreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate, this effect is partial.   Furthermore, the rand will also remain sensitive to domestic developments, including the slow pace of contraction in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. Wage and salary increases in excess of inflation and productivity growth also pose an upside risk to inflation.   The Committee assesses the risk to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, with the possibility of further electricity tariff increases accentuating this risk. 10 At the same time, the growth outlook remains constrained by electricity supply concerns and low business confidence, and the risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be moderately on the downside.   Demand pressures on inflation remain muted, reinforced by a moderately tighter fiscal policy stance. In its previous statement the Committee noted that the more favourable inflation path allowed for some room to pause in the process of domestic monetary policy normalisation.   The deterioration in the outlook suggests that this scope has narrowed.   However, given the uncertainties related to US policy normalisation and the weak state of the domestic economy, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now. The timing of future interest rate increases will be dependent, as before, on a range of domestic and external factors.   The MPC will remain vigilant and will not hesitate to act in order to maintain the integrity of the inflation targeting framework. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR

21 May 2015 

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The challenges facing monetary policy have persisted, and, as expected, the downward trend in inflation which was mainly attributable to the impact of lower oil prices, has reversed.   Headline inflation is expected to breach temporarily the upper end of the target range early next year, and thereafter remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target band for most of the forecast period.   The upside risks have increased, mainly due to further possible electricity price increases.   The exchange rate also continues to impart an upside risk to inflation as uncertainty regarding impending US monetary policy continues.   Domestic demand, however, remains subdued while electricity constraints continue to weigh on output growth and general consumer and business confidence. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,0 per cent and 4,5 per cent in March and April respectively.   The petrol price increase of R1,56 per litre in April resulted in a decline in the rate of disinflation from the transport category, from -5,0 per cent in March to -1,1 per cent 1 in April, while food price inflation moderated further.   The main contributions to the April headline rate came from the categories of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services, which together accounted for 3,2 percentage points of the outcome.   Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, moderated from 5,7 per cent in March to 5,6 per cent in April. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods appears to have reached a low point in February at 2,6 per cent, following the 3,1 per cent outcome in March, higher than market consensus.   While food price inflation moderated, the main upside contribution came from coal and petroleum products where disinflation slowed.   The recent increase in international oil prices and higher agricultural crop prices, along with further electricity price increases from mid-year are likely to sustain the upward momentum. The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed since the previous meeting of the MPC.   Inflation is now expected to average 4,9 per cent in 2015, with a first quarter low of 4,1 per cent.   A temporary breach of the upper end of the inflation target band is still expected during the first quarter of 2016, to peak at 6,8 per cent, and to decline to 6,0 per cent by the second quarter of that year.   An average inflation rate of 6,1 per cent is forecast for the year.   The forecast period has now been extended to the end of 2017, with an average inflation rate of 5,7 per cent expected for the year, and 5,6 per cent in the final quarter. 2 The forecast for core inflation has also increased marginally, to 5,6 per cent in 2015, and to 5,4 per cent in 2016.   Core inflation is expected to average 5,2 per cent in 2017, with a final quarter average of 5,1 per cent.   Much of the persistence of core inflation at these levels is attributed to high levels of wage growth, currency depreciation and inflation expectations entrenched at the upper end of the target range. The headline inflation forecast assumes electricity price increases of 13,0 per cent from July 2015 and July 2016 in line with the original multi-year price determination process of Nersa.   However, the application by Eskom for a further 12,6 per cent increase from 1 July 2015 will be decided at the end of June.   Given the uncertainty regarding this decision, both in terms of quantum and timing of implementation, it has not been incorporated into the forecast, but poses a significant upside risk.   Should Nersa fully accede to the Eskom request, a higher peak of headline inflation as well as a more extended breach of the target can be expected.   The direct and indirect effects of such an increase could increase average inflation by around 0,5 percentage points over a year. The BER inflation expectations survey for the second quarter of 2015 will only be released in June.   Median inflation expectations as reflected in the Reuters Econometer poll, at 4,9 per cent and 5,9 per cent for 2015 and 2016, are similar to the Bank’s forecast, although there is a fairly wide dispersion between respondents.   The break-even inflation rates, as reflected in the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, have been more volatile, and are 3 above the upper end of the target range over all maturities, having reversed their earlier declines this year. The outlook for the global economy is broadly unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC.   The US growth forecast for 2015 has been revised down by about half a percentage point following the broad-based first quarter estimate of 0,2 per cent, although this deterioration is generally believed to be temporary.   Growth of around 3,0 per cent is now expected in 2015, still above estimated potential.   Eurozone growth has surprised on the upside, and while still relatively subdued at an expected 1,5 per cent for 2015, there are indications that the region is responding to the ECB monetary stimulus.   Any possible fall-out from the debt crisis in Greece remains uncertain.   Japan is expected to growth by just below one per cent this year. Growth in some of the larger emerging markets remains weak.   Negative growth is being experienced in Brazil and Russia, and although the Chinese economy is still slowing, with first quarter growth of around 5,3 per cent, a hard landing is not expected amid further monetary policy easing.   By contrast, the Indian economy has been performing strongly, partly in response to policy reforms.   While growth in Africa has remained relatively robust, downside risks have emerged in some of the oil and commodity-producing countries. Global inflation remains benign, but the partial recovery in the international oil price has ameliorated the deflationary risks in some of the advanced economies in particular.   Higher, but still low, inflation expectations contributed to a sharp rise in bond yields in some of the advanced economies, with spillovers to other bond 4 markets.   However, most central banks remain in loosening mode, with further reductions in policy interest rates in a number of countries since the previous meeting of the MPC.   A notable exception has been Brazil, where monetary policy was tightened for the third time this year. Global financial markets remain focused on the timing of US monetary policy tightening.   Low inflation and the weaker first quarter growth outcome have pushed out expectations regarding the starting date, but financial markets generally expect the first move to be during 2015, most likely in September, followed by a gradual data dependent tightening cycle.   Continued financial market volatility is likely to ensue with each relevant data release. The uncertainty regarding US growth prospects contributed to a weakening of the dollar against most currencies in recent weeks.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand traded in a relatively narrow band of between R11,80 and R12,20 against the US dollar, and is currently almost unchanged since then.   However, in line with dollar weakening, the rand has depreciated by 0,6 per cent against the euro and by 4,0 per cent against the pound sterling.   On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by 0,3 per cent. The rand continues to be vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of global risk perceptions and associated capital flows, particularly in response to anticipated changes to US monetary policy.   At the same time, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the extent to which US monetary policy normalisation has been priced into the rand.   However, past patterns suggest that some further pressure is likely on the exchange 5 rate and long bond yields as the start of the US tightening cycle becomes more certain.   Reflecting this uncertainty, non-resident bond and equity flows have been quite volatile.   According to JSE data, non-residents have been net buyers of bonds and equities to the value of around R15 billion since the beginning of this year. The rand therefore remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook, although the degree of upside risk is tempered somewhat by the continued relatively low level of pass-through to consumer price inflation.   The Bank estimates that the actual pass- through could be about half of what is currently implied in the forecast model, but it is still uncertain as to whether this reflects a permanent change or a temporary phenomenon which can reverse rapidly. The domestic growth outlook remains weak, amid continued electricity supply constraints and low and declining levels of business and consumer confidence.   The Bank’s forecast for GDP growth is marginally down from the previous forecast: growth is expected to average 2,1 per cent and 2,2 per cent in 2015 and 2016, and to increase to 2,7 per cent in 2017.   Growth for the next two years therefore is expected to be more or less in line with our estimate of short-term potential output growth of between 2,0 and 2,5 per cent.   It also suggests that the negative output gap, currently estimated at around 1,5 per cent, is likely to persist.   This forecast makes an assumption regarding the persistence of electricity shortages, which are expected to be relieved somewhat only in 2017.   However, the risks to growth are assessed to be on the downside.   The moderate decline in the Bank’s composite leading business cycle indicator also suggests a continuation of the sluggish growth outlook. 6 Despite a strong performance by the mining sector in March, first quarter growth is expected to be subdued and much lower than the 4,1 per cent measured in the fourth quarter of 2014.   According to Statistics South Africa, the physical volume of mining output increased at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 1,9 per cent in the first quarter.   Platinum group metals output was particularly strong in March with a month- on-month increase of 26,6 per cent.   By contrast, manufacturing output appears to have contracted by about 0,6 per cent in the quarter, consistent with the continued decline in the Kagiso PMI, down to 45,4 index points in April, and the slight decline in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector.   The real value of building plans passed declined for a fourth successive month in February, in line with a weaker FNB/BER Building Confidence index in the first quarter of the year. Consumption expenditure by households is expected to remain relatively subdued, as higher personal tax rates take effect and the benefits of lower petrol prices dissipate.   There are mixed signals from the retail trade sales which rebounded strongly in February but then contracted in March on a month-on-month basis.   A quarterly growth rate of 0,9 per cent was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.   Growth in expenditure on durable goods in particular is expected to decline, as reflected in the sluggish new vehicle sales, which decreased further in April.   The FNB/BER consumer confidence index declined sharply in the first quarter of 2015, signalling modest growth in consumption expenditure going forward. Subdued levels of household consumption expenditure are reflected in credit extension by banks to households, where the divergence between households and 7 corporates continues.   Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector was 13,9 per cent in March 2015, compared with 3,6 per cent to households.   The latter is reflective of continued weak growth across all the main categories of credit, influenced by both supply and demand factors.   These trends are likely to be reinforced further by the implementation of affordability assessment regulations as part of revisions to the National Credit Regulations in March.   The impending changes in the Basel III regulatory requirements are also contributing to relatively tight credit conditions.   At the same time, weak employment growth, high debt levels and continued household deleveraging, as well as expectations of higher interest rates may have impacted on the demand for credit. Trends in remuneration growth remain a concern to the MPC.   Average wage and salary growth has been in excess of inflation for some time, imparting some degree of automatic indexation to wage settlements, and therefore maintaining higher levels of inflation.   In the fourth quarter of 2014, year-on-year growth in nominal remuneration per worker in the non-agricultural formal sector increased by 7,7 per cent.   Once accounting for labour productivity growth of 1,3 per cent, unit labour costs showed an increase of 6,3 per cent, from 5,7 per cent in the previous quarter.   According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements measured 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2015.   The public sector wage settlement appears to have been settled at an increase of 7 per cent, but the full impact on the total government wage bill is still unclear.   Upside risks to inflation from wage pressures are still expected, with the unresolved settlements in the coal and gold mining sectors of particular concern. 8 While high wage settlements could underpin household consumption expenditure, this could be offset in part by inevitable reductions in employment. Food price inflation is expected to contribute to upside inflation pressures.   This is despite the continued moderation of global food prices and a recent declining trend of food price inflation at the CPI level and lower meat price inflation at the producer price level.   Food price inflation measured 5,0 per cent in April following eight successive months of moderation.   Similarly, final manufactured food producer price inflation moderated to 5,8 per cent in March.   However, domestic drought conditions have resulted in a need to import yellow maize, contributing to maize prices rising close to import parity levels.   These pressures, along with the weaker exchange rate, are expected to reverse the favourable trend in food price inflation by the second half of this year. The international oil price appears to have stabilised in the US dollar 60-US dollar 70 per barrel range, as capital expenditure plans have been scaled back following the collapse of prices in the later part of last year.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, Brent crude oil prices have increased by about US dollar 10 per barrel.   Domestic petrol prices remained unchanged in May, but a further increase of around 50 cents per litre, should current trends persist, is likely in June, attributable mainly to higher international product prices. 9 Although the upward revision of the inflation forecast was relatively small, the persistence of medium term inflation at elevated levels and the deteriorating risks to the outlook are an increasing concern to the MPC.   While currently the breach is expected to be temporary, the longer term trajectory is close to the upper end of the target range, and the upside risks make this trajectory vulnerable to any significant changes in inflation pressures. The main risks to the outlook remain electricity tariff increases, the exchange rate and wage settlements.   Significant additional electricity tariff increases are likely to cause inflation to diverge significantly from the target range for a more extended period than our baseline forecast suggests.   The rand remains vulnerable to global market reaction to US policy normalisation, particularly in the context of South Africa’s twin deficits.   Any significant weakening of the exchange rate in reaction to US monetary policy tightening could cause inflation to diverge even further from target, and set in motion an exchange rate-inflation spiral.   Furthermore, the possibility of a wage-price spiral, should settlements well in excess of inflation become an economy-wide norm, also poses a risk to the outlook. The MPC recognises that domestic inflation is not driven by demand factors that are more easily dealt with through monetary policy responses.   Household consumption expenditure remains relatively subdued.   While monetary policy should generally look through supply side shocks, such as large electricity tariff increases and oil price changes, we have to be mindful of the second-round effects of such shocks.   In particular, we need to monitor closely the possible impact on inflation expectations 10 which remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range over the longer term. Growth remains fragile, constrained by electricity shortages and low business confidence and the risk to the outlook remain on the downside.   But this cannot be solved by monetary policy alone.   Monetary policy action will need to achieve a fine balance between achieving our primary mandate of price stability and not undermining growth unduly. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at this meeting.   Four members of the committee favoured an unchanged stance while two favoured a 25 basis point increase.   The deteriorating inflation outlook suggests that this unchanged stance cannot be maintained indefinitely.   The MPC will continue to closely monitor the evolution of inflation expectations and other factors that could undermine the longer term inflation outlook and stands ready to act when appropriate. From the next meeting in July the Bank will take further steps to increase transparency by publishing the assumptions underlying the Bank’s forecast with the MPC statement.

23 July 2015 

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the global environment has been dominated by heightened uncertainty relating to the debt crisis in Greece and the sharp decline in equity prices in China.   While the tail risks from these events appear to have dissipated somewhat, uncertainties still remain.   At the same time, the risks associated with financial market volatility related to the timing of the first increase in the US policy rate persist.   Domestically, the growth outlook remains weak, as both the supply and demand sides remain constrained amid declining business and consumer confidence.   The inflation forecast has deteriorated slightly since the previous meeting, notwithstanding the lower-than- expected outcome in June.   Headline inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range during the first two quarters of next year, while upside risks posed by the exchange rate have increased. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,6 per cent and 4,7 per cent in May and June respectively. 1 The latter surprised on the downside, due inter alia to lower than expected increases in food price and rental inflation, with upside pressures coming from higher petrol prices.   The categories of housing and utilities, food and non-alcoholic beverages, and miscellaneous goods and services contributed 3,1 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, moderated from 5,7 per cent in May to 5,5 per cent in June. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods continued its upward trend having reached a low point of 2,6 per cent in February.   In April and May, the PPI measured 3,0 per cent and 3,6 per cent respectively.   The latter was above market consensus, and driven by higher than expected food, beverage and tobacco product prices, which, at 2,2 percentage points, was also the main contributor to the annual change in the PPI.   The upward trend is expected to persist, driven by rising agricultural crop prices and electricity tariffs. The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with headline inflation now expected to average 5,0 per cent in 2015, up from 4,9 per cent previously.   The forecast for the first two quarters of next year has also been revised up by 0,1 percentage point to 6,9 per cent and 6,1 per cent respectively, with a return to within the target range by the third quarter.   However, the forecast average inflation for both 2016 and 2017 is unchanged at 6,1 per cent and 5,7 per cent. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged, and expected to average 5,6 per cent in 2015, and moderating to 5,4 per cent and 5,2 per cent in the next two years.   As before, much of the persistence of core inflation at these levels is attributed to high 2 levels of wage growth, currency depreciation and inflation expectations entrenched at the upper end of the target range. The headline inflation forecast assumes electricity price increases of 13,0 per cent from July 2016 and July 2017.   Although the current multi-year price determination allows for an 8 per cent increase from July next year, Eskom is expected to apply for a claw-back on diesel usage, and this accounts for the additional 5 percentage point assumption in the model.   The main assumptions underlying the model are listed in the annexure to this statement. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University have shown a near-term deterioration, but are more or less unchanged over the 2 to 3 year horizon.   Average inflation expectations for 2015 and 2016 increased by 0,2 percentage points, to 5,6 per cent and 6,1 per cent, but declined marginally to 5,8 per cent for 2017.   The deterioration was mainly driven by marked increases of 0,6 and 0,4 percentage points by analysts for 2015 and 2016, and smaller increases by business people.   The expectations of analysts and trade unionists remain within the target, but close to the upper end of the target range.   The expectations of business people are above the target range with a deterioration over all three years.   Average 5-year inflation expectations increased from 5,8 per cent to 6,0 per cent. The median inflation expectations of analysts polled in the Reuters Econometer survey are almost identical to the Bank’s forecast.   The break-even inflation expectations as reflected in the yield differential between conventional government 3 bonds and inflation linked bonds are relatively unchanged since the previous meeting, and remain above the target range for all maturities. Global economic growth has been revised downwards recently, mainly due to the weak first quarter outcome in the US.   While the recovery in the US still appears to be on track amid continued improvements in the labour market, growth this year is expected to be closer to the 2 per cent level, compared with expectations of around 3 per cent earlier in the year.   The steady, but slow improvement in the euro area has continued, following a better-than-expected first quarter outcome.   However, the outlook for the region will be dependent in part on avoiding negative spillovers from the Greek debt crisis.   The near term risks from this crisis appear to have been averted for now, but the longer term sustainability of the Greek debt burden remains a concern.   Growth in Japan is expected to remain positive but subdued. The Chinese economy grew at a year-on-year rate of 7,0 per cent in the second quarter, but some moderation is expected in the coming quarters.   The sharp correction in the Chinese equity markets appears to have been contained by strong intervention by the authorities, and the impact on the broader economy is expected to be relatively limited, but it does point to some fragility in the financial sector.   The slowdown in China has continued to impact on commodity prices, with the platinum price, for example, declining to its lowest level in six years.   The prospects for a number of other larger emerging market economies, particularly Russia and Brazil, remain weak. 4 Global inflation pressures, particularly in the advanced economies remain benign, reinforced by declining commodity prices, including oil.   Against this backdrop, the monetary policy stances in most advanced and emerging market economies have either remained unchanged or become more accommodative since the previous MPC meeting, with the exception of Brazil where interest rates were increased further.   Monetary policies in the advanced economies are likely to remain asynchronous: highly accommodative stances in the Eurozone and Japan are likely to persist for some time, while a start of monetary policy tightening is likely in the US sometime this year, followed by the UK. The rand exchange rate has been relatively volatile and depreciated significantly since the previous meeting of the MPC.   The rand, along with a number of other emerging market currencies, has been particularly sensitive to changing global risk perceptions relating to the Greek crisis, the volatility in the Chinese equity markets, declining commodity prices and expectations of the start of US monetary policy tightening.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand traded in a wide band of between R11,82 and R12,58 against the US dollar.   Over the period, the rand has depreciated by 5,0 per cent against the US dollar, by 3,6 per cent against the euro and by 3,5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand found some support from the improved current account outcome of 4,8 per cent of GDP in the first quarter of 2015, and the more favourable recent trade data.   Whilst these better outcomes may reflect the depreciated real effective exchange rate, further gains are likely to be constrained by the recent decline in commodity 5 prices.   The Bank forecasts a current account deficit of around 4,6 per cent of GDP for the year. Global capital flows have remained relatively volatile against the backdrop of changing risk perceptions.   This has been reflected in non-resident bond and equity flows: according to JSE data, non-residents were net sellers of South African government bonds to the value of R12,7 billion in May and June, but were net buyers of equities to the value of R17,7 billion.   To date in July, non-residents have been net buyers of equities and bonds to the value of R3,7 billion and R2,4 billion respectively. The rand remains a significant risk factor to the inflation outlook given the vulnerability of the rand and long bond yields to possible US interest rate increases, as well as a deterioration in South Africa’s terms of trade.   The inflation forecast assumes a relatively stable real effective exchange rate over the forecast period, implying a nominal effective depreciation in line with inflation differentials between South Africa and her major trading partners.   A nominal depreciation in excess of this would pose an upside risk to inflation, although this risk could be ameliorated to some extent should the relatively low pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation persist.   The extent to which US policy tightening is already priced into the exchange rate also remains uncertain. The domestic growth outlook remains subdued, amid continued electricity supply constraints, and weak business and consumer confidence.   Growth in the first quarter of 2015 measured 1,3 per cent, and high frequency data suggest that the second quarter growth is likely to be broadly similar.   The Bank’s forecast for growth in each 6 year of the forecast period has been revised down marginally, to 2,0 per cent in 2015 and 2,1 per cent in 2016, and rising to 2,6 per cent in 2017 when some easing of the electricity supply constraint is assumed.   However, the risks to growth are still assessed to be moderately on the downside.   The recent further decline in the Bank’s composite leading business cycle indicator also suggests a continuation of the weak growth outlook. The RMB/BER business confidence index has declined for two consecutive quarters, measuring 43 index points in the second quarter of 2015, with confidence in the manufacturing sector particularly low, at 29 index points.   The physical volume of manufacturing production has contracted on a month-on-month basis in three of the first five months of this year, and this sector is expected to record negative growth in the second quarter.   Although the PMI improved in May and June, it remains around the 50 index point level, consistent with a constrained outlook.   The mining sector, by contrast, has displayed some resilience, particularly in the PGM sub-sector, although the weaker platinum and palladium prices are expected to create further headwinds. Underlying this subdued growth outlook is the persistent weakness in growth in gross fixed capital formation, particularly by the private sector.   These trends contributed to a contraction in non-agricultural formal sector employment on both a quarter-on-quarter basis, and a year-on-year basis.   During the four quarters to the first quarter of 2015, over 41 000 jobs were shed, of which just over 30 000 were in the private sector. Although consumption expenditure of households improved somewhat in the first quarter of 2015, this was probably induced by temporary factors including the decline 7 in the petrol price and lower food price inflation.   However, following the increase in personal income taxes alongside higher electricity tariffs and a reversal of the petrol price declines, the outlook for consumption expenditure has deteriorated.   This negative outlook is reflected in slowing retail sales growth, declining motor vehicle sales and the continued weak pace in credit extended to households by the banking sector.   Tighter affordability criteria as well as proposals to cap interest charges on unsecured loans are likely to constrain bank credit extension to households further.   This is in contrast to the continued buoyant growth in credit extension to the corporate sector.   Against this backdrop, the FNB/BER consumer confidence index reached a 14-year low in the second quarter of 2015. Notwithstanding the recent moderation in nominal wage growth, the pace of growth remains high and contributes to the persistence of inflation at higher levels.   Year-on- year growth in nominal salaries and wages per worker moderated to 6,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, from 7,3 per cent in the previous quarter.   Adjusting for productivity increases, due in part to employment reductions, labour cost increases declined to 4,1 per cent in the first quarter.   According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements declined to 7,8 per cent in the first half of 2015, compared with 8,1 per cent in 2014 as a whole. Food prices remain a concern to the MPC, despite the continued moderation of food price inflation at the CPI level having measured 4,6 per cent in May and 4,3 per cent in June.   However, the continuing drought in parts of the country has contributed to the upside risk to the outlook, despite benign global food price inflation.   Maize and wheat prices have increased significantly since the beginning of the year, and we are 8 yet to see the full impact on consumer prices.   At the PPI level, however, cereal and crop price inflation accelerated to 17,8 per cent in May, and both wheat and maize prices are now trading at around import parity levels. International oil prices have been somewhat weaker since the previous meeting of the MPC, following higher output by Saudi Arabia, and the prospects of a resumption of oil exports by Iran.   This follows two consecutive months of oil prices in the range of US dollar 60-65 per barrel.   Since early July, spot prices have traded below US dollar 60 per barrel, while futures prices are currently trading at around US dollar 58 per barrel for December delivery.   The Bank’s forecast assumes a moderate increase in oil prices over the forecast period.   Domestic petrol prices have increased by about 90 cents per liter in the past two months, but should current trends persist, a price reduction of around 40 cents per litre is likely in August. While the June inflation outcomes were below expectations, this respite is expected to be temporary.   The persistence of forecast inflation at elevated levels and the continued upside risks to the outlook remain a concern to the MPC.   Although inflation is currently within the target range, given the lags in monetary policy changes on inflation, the focus of policy continues to be on the medium term trend, and to ensure that inflation remains comfortably and sustainably within the target range. Inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range for two quarters, and the medium term trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range.   The upside risks make this trajectory vulnerable to any significant changes in inflation pressures. 9 Although the risks of higher electricity tariffs did not materialise as yet, other upside risks persist.   The rand remains vulnerable to global market reaction to US monetary policy normalisation, particularly in the context of South Africa’s twin deficits.   The pressures on the exchange rate have been exacerbated by the recent significant decline in commodity prices, which are likely to impede the favourable current account adjustment.   Some of the rand adjustment has already occurred since the previous meeting, but further reaction to US monetary policy tightening could cause inflation to diverge even further from target, and set in motion an exchange rate- inflation spiral.   Further upside risks are expected to come from food prices, which have yet to react to significant increases in spot prices of agricultural commodities. The MPC has indicated for some time that it is in a hiking cycle in response to rising inflation risks, and a normalisation of the policy rate over time.   The MPC is cognisant of the fact that domestic inflation is not driven by demand factors, and the outlook for household consumption expenditure remains subdued.   Economic growth remains subdued, constrained by electricity supply disruptions and low business and consumer confidence and the risks to the outlook remain on the downside.   However, as emphasised previously, we have to be mindful of the risk of second-round effects on inflation, and the committee is concerned that failure to act against these heightened pressures and risks will cause inflation expectations to become entrenched at higher levels. The MPC has therefore decided to continue on its path of gradual policy normalisation.   Accordingly, the repurchase rate will increase by 25 basis points to 6,0 per cent per annum with effect from Friday 24 July 2015.   Four members 10 favoured a 25 basis point increase, while two members favoured an unchanged stance. The expected inflation trajectory implies that the real repurchase rate remains low and possibly still slightly negative at times, and below its longer term average.   The monetary policy stance therefore remains supportive of the domestic economy.   The continuing challenge is for monetary policy to achieve a fine balance between achieving our core mandate of price stability and not undermining short term growth unduly.   Monetary policy actions will continue to be sensitive, to the extent possible, to the fragile state of the economy.   As before, any future moves will therefore be highly data dependent.

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, risks to the global economic outlook have increased against the backdrop of a slowing Chinese economy.   These risks, in conjunction with continued capital outflows from emerging markets, have resulted in heightened global financial market volatility and contributed to the decision by the US Fed to maintain its current monetary policy stance.   This delay has added uncertainty to an already volatile global setting. The domestic economic outlook has deteriorated following the surprise contraction in the second quarter of the year.   At the same time, the rand experienced a further significant depreciation in response to domestic and global developments, intensifying the upside risks to the inflation outlook.   The combination of sharply slowing growth and rising inflation compounds the dilemma facing monetary policy. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent in July and August respectively. 1      The decrease in the inflation in August was mainly the result of changes in the housing and utilities and transport indices.   Having reached a recent high of 5,8 per cent in January and February, the Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5,3 per cent, down from 5,4 per cent in July. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from 3,3 per cent in July to 3,4 per cent in August, down from 3,7 per cent in June.   The upward trend is expected to continue in the coming months as the impact of higher agricultural crop and food prices becomes more apparent. The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally, with a near term improvement and a slight medium term deterioration.   Inflation is now expected to average 4,7 per cent in 2015, from 5,0 per cent previously, and then to breach the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of 2016, with a peak of 6,7 per cent (previously 6,9 per cent).   Inflation is then expected to be around the top end of the target range with a further temporary breach of 6,2 per cent in the final quarter.   This breach is mainly due to base effects from the lower starting point for the petrol price in the fourth quarter of this year.   The forecast for 2017 follows a slow downward trend, with inflation measuring 5,7 per cent in the final quarter.   The changes in this trajectory are mainly due to the more depreciated starting point for the real effective exchange rate, which is offset to some extent by a lower international oil price assumption. The forecast for core inflation is marginally higher in the later quarters, but with an unchanged expected average of 5,4 per cent in 2016, and slightly higher at 5,3 per cent in 2017, up from 5,2 per cent. 2          Inflation expectations as measured by the survey conducted in the third quarter by the Bureau for Economic Research are more or less unchanged and remain at the upper end of the target range.   Average inflation expectations for 2016 are unchanged at 6,1 per cent, and reverted to 5,9 per cent for 2017, following the decline to 5,8 per cent in the previous quarter.   As before, there were marked differences between the different categories of respondents, with the 2017 expectations averaging 5,4 per cent for financial analysts, 6,5 per cent for business people and 5,9 per cent for trade unionists.   Average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 6,0 per cent to 5,9 per cent, but those of business people reverted back to their 2014 level of 6,5 per cent, from 6,3 per cent previously. Median annual inflation expectations of market analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey are almost identical to those of the Bank’s forecast and more or less unchanged since the previous survey.   The breakeven inflation rates derived from the inflation-linked bonds have increased moderately since the previous meeting, and have remained above the upper end of the target range across all maturities. The global economic outlook has become more uncertain since the previous meeting of the MPC driven in part by the strong financial market reactions to the deteriorating outlook for the Chinese economy.   Although the growth prospects in the US remain positive, they have been clouded by the growing concerns about possible spillbacks from a slowdown in emerging markets, particularly in China, as well as from the impact of the strong dollar.   Euro area growth moderated in the second quarter and remains relatively subdued, while real output in Japan declined. 3          Growing concerns of the risk of an abrupt slowdown in the Chinese economy have been fuelled by excess capacity in the real estate market and in the industrial sectors of the economy.   The recent equity market correction, the surprise devaluation of the renminbi, and the uncertain policy responses have added to these concerns.   While to date the actual slowdown has been relatively moderate, a hard landing could have a severe impact on global markets, and on commodity prices in particular. These developments have had an adverse effect on the outlook for commodity producers, particularly emerging market economies, but Asian economies with close trade links with China have also been affected.   The deteriorating terms of trade have compounded the impact of continued capital flows from emerging markets in anticipation of US monetary policy normalisation.   Consensus growth forecasts for most Latin American and Asian economies have accordingly been revised downwards. Lower commodity prices have contributed to a more benign global inflation environment, although some emerging markets are experiencing inflationary pressures through depreciating currencies.   In the United States, concerns about the possible restraining effect of the appreciating dollar on domestic economic activity and inflation, coupled with global financial market volatility and the risks of a sharp slowdown in emerging markets were key factors in the decision to delay the commencement of monetary policy normalisation.   The ECB has indicated that further monetary easing is being contemplated while developments in Japan suggest that monetary policies will remain highly accommodative for some time. Domestic financial markets, including bond and equity markets, have not been immune to the turmoil in global markets.   Although the rand has been one of the more 4          volatile currencies, having fluctuated in a range of between around R12,60 and just over R14,00 against the US dollar since the previous MPC meeting, its trend depreciation over the year has not been significantly different to those of other commodity currencies and a number of other peer emerging economies.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by about 9 per cent against the US dollar, by about 10 per cent against the euro and by about 8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand was negatively impacted by developments in China, continued speculation regarding the timing of US policy “take-off”, and the weaker-than-expected GDP growth outcome.   The rand reacted positively to the US decision to maintain its policy stance, as well as to the narrowing deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. The rand exchange rate remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook.   As noted in previous statements, a key uncertainty for the MPC is the extent to which the US policy normalisation is already priced into the currency.   The fact that the rand appreciated in response to the Fed decision suggests that some depreciation is likely when US rates are increased.   However, the extent is uncertain, with the possibility of a temporary overshoot in a highly volatile environment. A further uncertainty relates to the sustainability of the contraction in the current account of the balance of payments in the second quarter when a deficit of 3,1 per cent of GDP was recorded.   While this narrowing is attributed in part to temporary factors, there appears to be some evidence that both export and import volumes are responding to the depreciation of the rand and the weaker economy.   However, the Bank expects this process of adjustment to remain slow, with the export response 5          inhibited by a number of factors including headwinds from the slowing global economy, electricity supply constraints and declining tourism receipts. The domestic economic growth outlook deteriorated compared with the previous forecast.   This follows the surprise annualised contraction of 1,3 per cent in the second quarter of this year.   While the MPC is of the view that a further contraction is unlikely in the third quarter, the outlook remains relatively weak amid declining business and consumer confidence.   The Bank’s forecast for growth has been revised down by half a percentage point in each year of the forecast period, to 1,5 per cent in 2015, and to 1,6 per cent and 2,1 per cent in the subsequent two years.   The Bank’s estimate of potential output for 2015 has also been revised down to 1,8 per cent.   The risks to the growth outlook are now seen to be more or less balanced.   This weak outlook is consistent with the Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity which has exhibited a more pronounced downward trend in recent months. The growth disappointment was particularly evident in the goods-producing sectors of the economy, with contractions in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, although growth in the services sectors also moderated.   The agricultural sector remains constrained by the continuing drought, and although mining output increased in July, prospects are being negatively affected by weak commodity prices, lower global demand and the risk of industrial action in parts of the sector.   Manufacturing output also increased marginally in July but the decline in the Barclays PMI to below the neutral 50 level in August, and a further decline in capacity utilisation suggest a challenging outlook. Growth in gross fixed capital formation moderated to 1,0 per cent in the second quarter, with general government providing the only notable increase.   The weak 6          contribution from the private sector is reflected in the further sharp decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to its lowest level since 2011.   The only area where private sector investment increased markedly was with respect to energy- generation projects.   This disappointing scenario does not bode well for employment growth, despite the decline in the official unemployment rate to 25,0 per cent in the second quarter, mainly due to growth in informal sector employment. Growth in consumption expenditure by households also reflects the subdued demand conditions in the economy, with a moderation in growth to 1,2 per cent in the second quarter, with some resilience only evident in semi-durable goods consumption.   Retail sales grew only marginally in July, amid a sharp decline in the business confidence of retailers.   The weakness in durable goods sales is evident in the lower new vehicles sales in August, particularly commercial vehicles. Consumers are expected to remain constrained against the backdrop of slow employment growth, declining disposable income growth, and rising inflation.   Furthermore, the pace of credit extension to households, which remains negative in real terms, is expected to be impacted further by the tighter affordability criteria following the implementation of amendments to the National Credit Regulations.   At the same time, household deleveraging has continued with the debt to disposable income ratio moderating further to 77,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, its lowest level since 2006.   Credit extension to the corporate sector, by contrast has been buoyant, particularly with respect to general loans and mortgage advances. No new data concerning wage and unit labour cost developments have become available since the previous meeting of the MPC, but trends are expected to be 7          relatively unchanged, with average nominal wage growth in excess of inflation contributing to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Although food price developments have been relatively benign, they remain a concern to the MPC with the expectation of an acceleration in the coming months as the impact of the drought feeds through to consumer prices.   This is despite the favourable impact of falling prices at the global level.   Domestic food price inflation at the consumer level appears to have reached a low point of 4,3 per cent in June, increasing marginally to 4,4 per cent in July and August.   The pressures are expected to come from the drought-induced increases in agricultural price inflation for cereals and crops which increased at a year-on-year rate of 38,7 per cent in July. The recent decline in international oil prices has provided some respite to inflation pressures, with the price of Brent crude oil currently trading at around US dollar 10 per barrel lower than at the time of the previous MPC meeting.   The current global oversupply of crude oil coupled with the slowdown in China is expected to keep oil prices contained in the short to medium term.   The MPC revised down its oil price assumption by between US dollar 3 and US dollar 4 per barrel in each of the coming years.   However, the Committee assesses the risk to the oil price assumption to be on the downside, particularly in the short term.   The domestic petrol price declined by a cumulative R1,20 per litre in August and September, and current trends suggest that no significant change is likely in October, with the weaker rand offsetting the impact of the falling dollar price of oil. The inflation outlook remains a concern for the Monetary Policy Committee, with the risks to the forecast assessed to be on the upside.   Although two breaches of the target are now expected - in the first and fourth quarters of next year - they are 8          expected to be temporary and primarily the result of base effects from lower petrol prices four quarters previously. Nevertheless, the Monetary Policy Committee is concerned that the longer-term inflation trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range, and given the upside risks to inflation, the probability of a more extended breach than currently forecast is relatively high.   A sustained breach of the target range has the danger that it could impact negatively on inflation expectations which are currently sticky at the upper end of the target range. The MPC is also concerned about domestic growth prospects, with the economy contracting in the second quarter.   Growth is expected to remain constrained by global developments and associated uncertainty and volatility, low business and consumer confidence and electricity supply shortages.   Domestic inflation is not driven by demand factors, and the outlook for household consumption expenditure has deteriorated.   However, we have to be mindful of the second-round effects of supply-side shocks on inflation. There are a number of upside risks to the inflation outlook, the primary one being the exchange rate which has already depreciated significantly against the advanced economy currencies in response to global developments, and is still likely to react further to the commencement of US monetary policy tightening.   A further risk emanates from possible higher multi-year increases in electricity tariffs from the middle of next year. Downside risks to the inflation outlook include international oil prices should they be sustained at current levels.   In addition, weak domestic demand may continue to 9     constrain pricing power in the economy.   The Committee nevertheless assesses the overall risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside. As noted in previous statements, the MPC has to achieve a fine balance between realising its core mandate and not undermining short term growth unduly.   The MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now at 6,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains on a gradual policy normalisation path.   The Committee will continue to monitor developments closely, and will not hesitate to act appropriately should the risks to the inflation outlook deteriorate materially.   As before, any future moves remain highly data dependent.

19 November 2015 

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the inflation forecast has remained relatively unchanged but the risks to the forecast have increased.   The key risks are a marked depreciation of the rand; worsening drought conditions and their likely impact on food prices; and the possibility of additional electricity tariff adjustments.   At the same time the economy remains weak despite an improved performance in the manufacturing sector, but both the mining and agricultural sectors appear to have contracted further in the third quarter. Although global financial markets have stabilised somewhat since the previous meeting, the outlook for emerging markets in particular remains challenging.   The US Fed is likely to raise its policy rate in December, and further volatility in financial markets can be expected in the lead-up to this. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,7 per cent in October, following two consecutive months at 4,6 per cent.   Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation surprised again on the MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 1         downside at 4,8 per cent, with a contribution of 0,7 percentage points to the overall CPI outcome.   Services price inflation remained unchanged at 5,6 per cent, while goods price inflation increased to 3,7 per cent from 3,6 per cent previously.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5,2 per cent, down from 5,3 per cent in the previous two months. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from 3,4 per cent in August to 3,6 per cent in September.   The main pressure came from the category of food, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 2,0 percentage points to the outcome.   Food and agricultural crop price developments are expected to sustain the upward trend in PPI in the coming months. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a slight near-term improvement, while the medium-term forecast is marginally higher.   Inflation is now expected to average 4,6 per cent in 2015, and 6,0 per cent and 5,8 per cent in the next two years.   The anticipated breach of the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of 2016 is now expected to average 6,4 per cent, compared with 6,7 per cent previously.   The trajectory for the rest of the year is also slightly lower than previously forecast, with the temporary breach in the fourth quarter of 6,1 per cent.   The forecast for 2017 follows a slow downward trend, with inflation still expected to measure 5,7 per cent in the final quarter.   The changes in the forecast are due to a lower starting point for the forecast, lower international oil price assumptions, and an adjustment to fees for higher education which are more or less offset by a more depreciated starting point for the real effective exchange rate.   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 2          The forecast for core inflation is marginally higher, with an expected average of 5,5 per cent in 2016, and 5,4 per cent in 2017, mainly due to the more depreciated exchange rate assumption. The BER inflation expectations survey is only due for release in December.   The median inflation forecast of analysts polled in the latest Reuters Econometer survey is similar to that of the Bank, and also declined marginally since the previous survey.   The breakeven inflation rates, while having improved since the previous meeting, remain above the upper end of the target range. Divergent global developments continue to create a challenging environment for monetary policy.   Although the US recovery appears to be sustained with further improvements in the labour market, the strong dollar poses downside risks to both growth and inflation.   The UK economy also remains on its recovery path.   By contrast, the recovery in the euro area is much weaker, although the outlook is more favourable than it was earlier in the year.   The Japanese economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, with positive, but slow growth expected in the coming quarters. The Chinese economy shows signs of stabilising, aided by policy stimulus, but the medium-term outlook remains a concern.   There is still some uncertainty regarding the extent to which services output and consumption has compensated for the decline in industrial output and investment.   A tail-risk of a hard landing remains, which would have a significant impact on countries with direct trade linkages, particularly those in Asia, as well as on commodity prices. Russia and Brazil remain in recession, while the strong performance of the Indian economy has been sustained following a number of structural reforms.   The outlook   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 3          for sub-Saharan Africa, while still positive, has deteriorated in the wake of lower commodity prices, and further weakening could create greater headwinds for South African manufactured exports to this region. Global inflation trends are also benign, with concerns about deflation abating in most advanced economies.   Despite significant currency depreciations in commodity- producing economies in particular, inflation pressures have generally been surprisingly contained, with a few exceptions.   Emerging markets have had differing experiences: a number of countries in Latin America, particularly commodity producers, have tightened policy in recent months in response to incipient inflationary pressures, while others with low inflation, particularly in Asia, have loosened policy further. In the advanced economies, monetary policy divergence is expected to continue.   Monetary policy is set to remain accommodative in the euro area and Japan, with possible further quantitative easing, against a backdrop of slow growth and benign inflation pressures.   In the US, inflation and labour market dynamics, as well as Fed communication, suggest that in the absence of any major surprises or shocks, an increase in the policy rate can be expected in December.   Market expectations are for monetary policy tightening in the UK to commence sometime in the second half of 2016, later than previously expected. Although volatility in global asset markets has moderated amid improving risk sentiment, emerging market foreign exchange markets have been relatively volatile and vulnerable to capital outflows.   In the past three months South Africa has also seen net portfolio outflows: since the end of August, according to the JSE data, non-   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 4          resident sales of equities amounted to R25,9 billion, while net bond sales amounted to R5,9 billion. The rand exchange rate has been particularly volatile, even compared to its peers, as domestic factors also impacted on the currency.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by about 1,0 per cent against the euro but has depreciated by around 3,0 per cent against the dollar, and by 1,5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.   As before, the extent to which Fed tightening has been priced into the exchange rate remains uncertain.   Nevertheless, a high degree of volatility and overshooting of the exchange rate may be expected in the lead-up to, and in the immediate aftermath of the start of the US interest rate cycle.   Fed communication of future moves will be key.   To date, the indications are that a moderate policy hiking cycle will be pursued. The domestic economic growth prospects remain subdued amid weak business confidence, but a further contraction in the third quarter is not expected.   The Bank’s forecast for GDP growth has been revised down marginally for 2015 and 2016 to 1,4 per cent and 1,5 per cent, but remains unchanged at 2,1 per cent for 2017.   The estimate of short-term potential output remains unchanged at 1,8 per cent for this year, rising to 2,1 per cent in 2017.   The Bank’s composite leading business cycle indicator declined further in August, consistent with the fragile outlook. The manufacturing sector recovered somewhat in the third quarter, mainly due to a surprisingly strong performance in September, and is expected to have contributed positively to GDP growth.   However, the Barclays PMI declined further in October, and has been below the neutral level of 50 for three consecutive months, suggesting a constrained outlook for the sector.   The mining sector is expected to subtract from   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 5          GDP growth following a further contraction in the third quarter, while the continuing drought points to a third successive quarterly contraction for the agricultural sector.   The outlook for the construction sector is constrained following significant declines in new building plans passed, and reflected in a 9 point drop in the FNB/BER Building Confidence Index. Against this backdrop, formal sector employment trends remain disappointing.   According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa, employment in the formal non-agricultural sector declined in the second quarter of 2015, as the private sector continued to shed jobs.   Although the Quarterly Labour Force Survey indicates an increase in the number of persons employed in the third quarter, the number of unemployed persons rose sharply in the quarter as the number of new entrants increased.   Consequently, the official unemployment rate increased to 25,5 per cent in the third quarter. There are minimal demand side pressures in the economy, with consumption expenditure by households continuing to be inhibited inter alia by low consumer confidence, declining disposable income growth and slow employment growth.   The latest retail trade sales data suggest that household expenditure may have lost further momentum in the third quarter.   Durable goods sales remain under pressure, as indicated in the intensification of the downward trend in motor vehicle sales in recent months. Consumption expenditure is also constrained by the continued slow growth in credit extension to households by banks.   Unsecured lending remains subdued, and is likely to be impacted further by the recently announced caps on interest rates by the DTI, while the decline in growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance is   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 6          indicative of the softer motor vehicle sales.   Credit extension to corporates remains robust, particularly commercial mortgage finance, which reflects in part a switch away from funding in the bond market by property funds. The recent Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement signalled a continued commitment to fiscal consolidation by government, although at a slower pace.   Most of the expanded deficit is attributable to lower expected tax revenues in response to the weaker growth outlook. Trends in wage growth remain a concern, and contribute to the persistence of inflation at elevated levels.   Year-on-year growth in salaries and wages per worker accelerated to 8,7 per cent in second quarter of 2015, and after adjusting for labour productivity increases, total unit labour costs increased from 4,3 per cent to 5,1 per cent.   By contrast, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements recorded by Andrew Levy Employment Publications recorded a moderation to 7,7 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 8,1 per cent in 2014. Apart from the exchange rate, the main upside risks to inflation come from possible electricity tariff and food price increases.   Eskom’s Regulatory Clearing Account (RCA) application to Nersa to claw back excess expenditure of R22,8 billion is likely to lead to a further tariff increase, although the quantum and timing is uncertain.   This is in addition to the 12,2 per cent tariff increase already built into the inflation forecast for next year.   No provision is made for the RCA application in the forecast at this stage, but it is regarded as an upside risk. A higher food price trajectory has been incorporated in the forecast for some time, but food price inflation has surprised on the downside in recent months, despite   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 7          sharp increases in maize and cereals prices earlier in the year.   However, the increased intensity of the drought which has led to downward revisions of the domestic maize crop estimate, as well as incipient pressures evident in both the PPI and CPI, suggest that an acceleration in food price inflation is likely, adding to the upside risk to the inflation outlook. By contrast, international oil price developments are expected to remain benign with current spot prices below US dollar 45 per barrel, somewhat lower than those assumed over the forecast period.   Although petrol prices have contributed to a succession of downside inflation surprises in recent months, the beneficial impact of lower international oil prices on domestic petrol prices has been offset to some extent by the depreciation of the rand.   The latest data suggest that, should current trends continue, a small drop in the petrol price can be expected next month despite the further depreciation of the rand. Although the inflation forecast is relatively unchanged since the previous meeting, the upside risks to the inflation outlook are more pronounced.   As noted, these risks relate to the persistent exchange rate depreciation, electricity tariffs and food prices, and are assessed to outweigh possible downside risks from lower international oil prices and subdued exchange rate pass-through.   While these factors cannot be dealt with directly through monetary policy, the concern of the Committee is that failure to act could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored and generate second-round effects and more generalised inflation.   Although core inflation has remained steady and inflation expectations to date have been relatively anchored, they remain at uncomfortably elevated levels.   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 8          The general approach of the MPC is to attempt to see through exogenous shocks and react to second-round effects.   However, shocks of a persistent nature, for example extended periods of currency depreciation or drought, or multi-year increases in electricity prices make it more difficult to disentangle these first and second round effects. In the absence of demand pressures, the MPC had to decide whether to act now or later.   On the one hand, given the relative stability in the underlying of core inflation, delaying the adjustment could give the MPC room to re-assess these unfolding developments at the next meeting, and avoid possible additional headwinds to the weak growth outlook.   On the other hand, delaying the adjustment further could lead to second-round effects and require an even stronger monetary policy response in the future, with more severe consequences for short-term growth. Complicating the decision was the deteriorating economic growth outlook.   Although the change to the growth forecast was marginal, the risks to the outlook, which were more or less balanced at the previous meeting, are now assessed to be on the downside. Against this difficult backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6,25 per cent per annum effective from 20 November 2015.   Four members preferred an increase, while two members favoured an unchanged stance. Despite the increase, the MPC still views the monetary policy stance to be accommodative.   The continuing challenge is for monetary policy to achieve a fine balance between achieving our core mandate of price stability and not undermining short-term growth unduly.   Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation within the target range while remaining sensitive, to the extent   MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 9     possible, to the fragile state of the economy.   As before, any future moves will therefore be highly data dependent. ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
