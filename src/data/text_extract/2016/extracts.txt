South African Reserve Bank Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the inflation outlook has deteriorated significantly, mainly due to exchange rate and food price developments.   The rand has depreciated considerably in response to domestic and external developments, while the impact of the worsening drought on food prices is becoming increasingly evident.   The outlook is complicated by the fact that the domestic growth outlook has weakened further.   The global backdrop has also become more challenging particularly for emerging markets, and downside risks to the sustainability of the recovery in the advanced economies have increased. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,2 per cent in December, up from 4,8 per cent in November.   This increase was broadly in line with market and the Bank’s expectations, and reflected in part the delayed response of food price inflation to the impact of the drought on agricultural prices.   Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerated to 5,9 per cent, up from 4,8 per cent previously and contributed 0,9 1      percentage points to the overall CPI outcome.   Goods price inflation increased to 4,6 per cent from 3,8 per cent previously mainly due to higher petrol and food prices, while services price inflation remained unchanged at 5,7 per cent.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, remained relatively stable at 5,2 per cent, up from 5,1 per cent in November. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from 4,3 per cent in November to 4,8 per cent in December.   The category of food, beverages and tobacco products contributed 2,1 percentage points to the December outcome. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a marked deterioration.   Having averaged 4,6 per cent in 2015, inflation is now expected to average 6,8 per cent in 2016 and 7,0 per cent in 2017.   This compares with the previous forecast of 6,0 per cent and 5,8 per cent for these years.   Inflation is still expected to breach the upper end of the target in the first quarter of 2016, but is now expected to remain outside the target for the entire forecast period.   A peak of 7,8 per cent is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, followed by a moderation to 6,2 per cent in the final quarter of that year (5,7 per cent previously).   The changes in the forecast are mainly due to a significantly more depreciated real exchange rate assumption, and higher expected food price inflation.   These upward revisions more than offset the impact of the lower international oil price assumption.   The electricity price assumption remains unchanged from the previous meeting. The forecast for core inflation has also deteriorated, although to a lesser degree than that for headline inflation.   Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range for four consecutive quarters from the third quarter of 2016, with a peak of 6,4 per cent in the final quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.   This measure 2          is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2016, and 5,9 per cent in 2017, and to moderate to 5,5 per cent by the final quarter of next year.   The deterioration in the forecast is mainly due to the more depreciated exchange rate assumption and expected higher unit labour costs. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research show a marginal upward movement for 2016 but a more pronounced deterioration for 2017, with average inflation expectations increasing from 5,9 per cent to 6,2 per cent, mainly due to the changes in expectations of trade union officials.   Five-year inflation expectations edged up to 6,1 per cent, also mainly due to changes in the expectations of trade union officials.   This survey was concluded prior to the depreciation of the rand in December, so the outcome of the next survey will be closely monitored. The impact of the rand exchange rate weakness on market forecasts is evident in the changes to the Reuters Econometer survey between December and January.   Median inflation expectations were stable in November and December, at 5,9 per cent and 5,8 per cent for 2016 and 2017, but increased in January to 6,0 per cent and 6,1 per cent.   The median forecast for 2018 is 5,7 per cent.   Break-even inflation rates also increased significantly across all maturities, with the 5-year maturities rising to current levels of around 7,3 per cent. The global growth outlook appears to have worsened somewhat in recent weeks, contributing to a correction in global equity markets.   Although most of the downward revisions to global growth have been due to the deteriorating prognosis for emerging markets, more recently the risks of a slowdown in the US have increased, amid declining consumer expenditure, and the impact of low oil prices and a strengthening 3          dollar on business investment.   However, despite the fourth quarter slowdown, growth of around trend is still generally expected.   While the recovery in the euro area remains modest, the growth forecasts for the UK and Japan have generally been revised down. Emerging market growth prospects, particularly for commodity-producing countries, remain constrained amid persistent capital outflows.   The outlook is heavily influenced by the slowing Chinese economy but there are conflicting views as to whether a hard landing can be expected.   There is also uncertainty regarding the efficacy of policy reforms that have been undertaken.   Perceptions of the modifications to the renminbi exchange rate regime as well as equity market volatility have added to this uncertainty. Global inflation pressures remain benign, reinforced by a further decline in international oil prices, but there have been upward revisions in some emerging markets.   Monetary policies in most advanced economies are expected to remain accommodative.   The slow pace of normalisation in the US is expected to continue, but further easing is expected in Japan and the euro area, while the Bank of England has indicated that monetary policy tightening is still some way off.   Divergent monetary policy paths are also expected in the emerging markets.   Commodity importers with sound macroeconomic fundamentals have scope for further easing, while some commodity producers, particularly those experiencing exchange rate- induced inflationary pressures, have been in a tightening mode, despite slowing growth. The exchange rate of the rand depreciated markedly since the previous meeting of the MPC, contributing significantly to the deterioration in the inflation forecast.   Since 4          the previous meeting, the rand has depreciated by 13,5 per cent against the US dollar, by 15,2 per cent against the euro, and by 12,9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.   The muted reaction of the exchange rate to the start of US Fed normalisation suggested that this move was more or less priced in, but this was overshadowed by the impact of domestic developments on the exchange rate earlier in the month. In early January, the rand reacted further to growing concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy.   While most emerging market currencies were affected, since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand’s depreciation has been in excess of most of its emerging market peers.   Other indicators such as widening credit spreads and the sharp increase in domestic bond yields point to a higher risk premium attached to South African assets. Although at current levels the rand may appear to be undervalued, divergences from equilibrium can persist for some time.   Furthermore, the current account adjustment remains slow, with the deficit expected to widen further in the face of continued weakness in commodity prices and higher drought-induced agricultural imports.   The financing of the deficit will also be more challenging in an environment of persistent capital outflows from emerging markets.   Since the previous meeting, non-residents have been net sellers of South African bonds and equities. From a monetary policy perspective, a key risk to the inflation outlook is not only the possibility of further depreciation, but also the extent to which the there is a change in the pass-through dynamics, which have been relatively muted in recent years. The domestic economic growth outlook remains weak, with further downward revisions to the Bank’s forecast.   Growth in 2015 is estimated to have averaged around 1,3 per cent, and is expected to moderate to 0,9 per cent in 2016, before 5          accelerating to 1,6 per cent in 2017.   This compares with the previous forecast of 1,5 per cent and 2,1 per cent for 2016 and 2017.   The Bank’s estimate of potential output growth was revised down from 1,9 per cent to 1,5 per cent for 2016, and from 2,1 per cent to 1,6 per cent for 2017.   Although there was a marginal increase in the Bank’s leading business cycle indicator in November, the trend remains negative, consistent with the subdued outlook.   The RMB/BER business confidence index declined further in the fourth quarter of 2015, to its lowest level in five years. High frequency data indicate that the mining sector remains under pressure in the face of declining commodity prices and weak demand.   Despite a recovery in the third quarter, the manufacturing sector outlook remains negative.   Capacity utilisation has declined further and the Barclays PMI, which has remained well below the neutral level for some months, is consistent with a contraction in the fourth quarter.   The continuing drought also means that near-term respite for the agricultural sector is unlikely. Underlying this growth outlook is the continued low growth in gross fixed capital formation, with private sector investment contracting in the third quarter.   The prospects for formal sector employment growth therefore remains bleak: the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa reports static employment levels over the four quarters to the third quarter of 2015. Growth in consumption expenditure by households also moderated in the third quarter, with contractions in spending on durable and non-durable goods.   Domestic motor vehicle sales reflected this weakness although recent retail sales data, particularly with respect to semi-durable goods, suggest there may have been a modest improvement in the final quarter of last year.   However, the decline in the 6          FNB/BER consumer confidence index in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a fourteen year low suggests that household consumption expenditure is likely to remain constrained. Credit extension to households has increased marginally recently, particularly with respect to mortgage and general loans.   However, these increases remain low and negative in real terms, while instalment sale credit continues to slow.   Tighter National Credit Act Regulations related to affordability assessments became effective from September, and are expected to constrain credit to households further.   While credit extension to corporates remains robust, it is relatively narrow-based, and reflects in part increased demand for mortgage loans by property funds. Wage and salary trends continue to contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels.   Year-on-year growth in nominal salaries and wages, while lower in the third quarter of last year, was still above the upper end of the inflation target range.   After adjusting for labour productivity increases, growth in total unit labour costs slowed marginally to 5,0 per cent in the third quarter.   Andrew Levy Employment Publications reported an average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements of 7,7 per cent in 2015. Food prices remain a significant risk to the inflation outlook.   The surge in agricultural commodity prices since early 2015 is beginning to impact on consumer food price inflation, and these pressures are likely to increase in the light of the persistent drought and the weaker exchange rate.   This is despite continued moderation in global food prices.   Although previous forecasts had incorporated an expectation of higher food price inflation, recent adverse developments have resulted in a further 7          deterioration of the Bank’s food price forecast, which is now expected to peak at around 11 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year. International oil prices have declined to multi-year lows since the previous MPC meeting.   The global oversupply and consequent low prices are expected to persist in the short term, particularly following the lifting of sanctions against Iran.   But with marginal producers expected to shut down or reduce production, prices are expected to follow a moderate upward trend over the forecast period.   The impact of this upward trend on domestic petrol prices has contributed to the higher inflation forecast in 2017 in particular.   The potentially favourable impact of the international oil price decline on domestic petrol prices has been more or less offset by the depreciation of the rand.   Petrol prices have declined only marginally since November, and the current under-recovery suggests a possible increase of around 7 cents per litre in February. Previously the Committee expressed concerns about the growing risks to the inflation outlook, mainly due to exchange rate and food price risks.   These risks appear to be materialising and have contributed to the significant deterioration of the inflation forecast.   The intensity of the drought has brought about a sizeable revision to the Bank’s food price outlook, while the exchange rate has depreciated significantly more than expected.   While oil prices have a moderating impact on the inflation outlook in the near term, base effects and the assumed upward trajectory contribute to the adverse inflation outlook in 2017.   The forecast also incorporates changes in administered prices, in particular for water, while an upside risk remains regarding electricity tariff increases. 8          The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be relatively balanced.   While there may be potential for further rand weakness in the short-term given the negative outlook for emerging markets in general as well as domestic factors, the lower observed exchange rate pass-through remains a mitigating factor.   However, there is still uncertainty as to the sustainability of this low pass-through, particularly in the face of large nominal exchange rate movements as recently experienced.   The upside risk from the exchange rate is more or less offset by the downside risks from the international oil price assumptions and projected food price inflation. Demand pressures remain constrained, and the focus of the MPC will therefore be on the evolution of inflation expectations and indications of second-round effects of the exogenous shocks to the inflation outlook.   There are some indications that inflation expectations may have deteriorated, but the extent of this will become more evident in the coming surveys.   The trend in core inflation provides some indication of the possible emergence of second-round effects.   Although core inflation has remained relatively contained in recent months, it is expected to accelerate and to exceed the upper end of the inflation target range for some time in response to exchange rate and wage pressures. The Committee faced the continuing dilemma of a deteriorating inflation environment and a worsening growth outlook.   The risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside, despite the downward revision to the forecast. Given the deterioration in the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 6,75 per cent per annum, effective from 29 January 2016.   Three members supported a 50 basis point increase, two members preferred a 25 basis point increase, while one member preferred no change. 9     The MPC still views the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative.   Despite the rate increase, the real repurchase rate remains low given the higher expected inflation over the period.   The MPC will remain focused on its core mandate of containing inflation within a flexible inflation targeting framework.   As noted on a number of occasions in the past, the MPC is of the view that the growth constraints facing the economy are primarily of a structural nature and cannot be solved solely by monetary policy.   Nevertheless, the MPC remains sensitive, to the extent possible, to the possible negative impact of monetary policy actions on cyclical growth.   As before, future moves will be highly data dependent. Lesetja Kganyago Governor

17 March 2016 

South African Reserve Bank Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, headline inflation has exceeded the upper end of the target range as pressures from higher food prices in particular have intensified.   Although the longer-term inflation outlook has improved somewhat, inflation is still expected to remain outside the target range for an extended period, and upside risks remain.   The domestic economic growth prospects remain fragile following a fairly broad-based weakening in the final quarter of last year, while global economic prospects remain uncertain. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased markedly in January to 6,2 per cent, up from 5,2 per cent in December.   Food price pressures intensified, with food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerating to 6,9 per cent, up from 5,9 per cent previously.   Goods price inflation increased from 4,6 per cent to 6,5 per cent, mainly due to higher food prices and base effects of petrol prices, while services price inflation increased from 5,7 per cent to 6,0 per cent.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, which had been relatively stable for some 1      time, increased from 5,2 per cent in December to 5,6 per cent in January.   Part of this may reflect some evidence of higher exchange rate pass-through. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods was also indicative of increased cost pressures, having increased from 4,8 per cent in December 2015 to 7,6 per cent in January.   The main contributor to this acceleration was the category of food, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 2,8 percentage points to the January outcome. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank has improved somewhat but nevertheless the protracted, albeit lower, breach remains a serious concern.   Inflation is now expected to average 6,6 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2016 and 2017, compared with 6,8 per cent and 7,0 per cent previously.   The forecast period has been extended to the end of 2018, and the forecast average for that year is 5,5 per cent.   Inflation is expected to peak at 7,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, down from 7,8 per cent previously, and to return to within the target range, to 5,5 per cent, during the fourth quarter of 2017.   Inflation is then expected to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period.   These changes are due in part to the higher interest rate assumption following the increase in the repo rate at the previous meeting, a slightly less depreciated exchange rate assumption, and downward revisions to the international oil price and electricity tariff assumptions.   The latter follows the Nersa decision to grant a lower-than-expected tariff adjustment of 9,4 per cent to Eskom.   These pressures are counteracted to some extent by a higher food price forecast. The forecast for core inflation reflects a marginal near-term deterioration, reflecting expected exchange rate and wage cost pressures, but is slightly improved for 2017.   Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second 2          quarter of 2016 for four consecutive quarters, with a peak at 6,5 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.   This measure is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2016, and 5,7 per cent and 5,2 per cent in the subsequent two years. The survey of inflation expectations conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research in the first quarter of 2016 presents a mixed picture.   Although average expectations remain unchanged at 6,2 per cent for 2016 and 2017, those of analysts increased significantly, while expectations of business people and trade unions moderated for both years.   Inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2018, with both analysts and trade unionists expecting inflation to be within the target range.   The 5-year average inflation expectations remained unchanged at 6,1 per cent, and have been stable within a range of between 5,8 per cent and 6,2 per cent since the first quarter of 2012. The near-term expectations of economic analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey also increased following the depreciation of the rand in December.   In the survey conducted in March, the median expectation for 2016 and 2017 was 6,4 per cent and 6,3 per cent, but inflation is expected to return to within the target range in 2018, at a 5,6 per cent average.   Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting and remain at fairly elevated levels. The international economic outlook remains challenging following a marked decline in global growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as a continued moderation in industrial production in the advanced economies.   This included a slowdown in the US, amid contractions in business fixed investment and exports, and a weakening in consumer spending.   Some improvement is expected in the first quarter, although 3          growth is expected to remain below potential in the coming months.   Subdued growth is expected in the Japanese economy following a contraction in the fourth quarter, with only a slightly more favourable outlook for the euro area and the UK. The outlook for many emerging market economies remains weak, with continuing recessions in Brazil and Russia.   The slowdown in China appears to be broad-based, with a declining PMI, moderating consumer demand, and lower imports and exports.   The uncertain prospects for China remain a source of intense speculation and uncertainty for the rest of the global economy. There are few signs of global inflation pressures, with inflation below target in most advanced economies, particularly in Japan and the euro area.   These trends, combined with slowing growth, have prompted looser monetary policies in a number of advanced economies, and accommodative policies are likely to persist.   Contrary to this trend, the US Fed is expected to continue on its normalisation path, but at a gradual pace.   By contrast, exchange-rate-induced inflation pressures persist in a number of emerging economies, particularly in Latin America, where more sustained tightening can be expected. The rand exchange rate has recovered somewhat from the lows experienced in December and January, but nevertheless remains highly volatile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand traded in a wide range of between around R16,40 and R15,07 against the US dollar, and has appreciated by 4,5 per cent against the US dollar, by 0,9 per cent against the euro, and by 2,0 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. A number of factors contributed to the appreciation of the rand during this period.   These included the reaction to further monetary policy easing in the advanced 4          economies, and the moderation of the US normalisation path; policy stimulus measures in China which overshadowed disappointing Chinese economic data; and the reaction to domestic monetary tightening.   Offsetting factors include the weak domestic growth outcome and higher inflation outlook; the increased risk of a sovereign ratings downgrade; and domestic political developments which have had a significant impact on the rand in the past few days in particular. The exchange rate was also negatively impacted by the wider-than-expected current account deficit, and its slow pace of adjustment to a depreciated exchange rate.   The adjustment is expected to remain slow, particularly in the context of declining global trade.   While the current account was adequately financed in the fourth quarter, the lack of portfolio capital flows remains a concern, despite expectations of some improvement of flows to emerging markets in 2016.   According to JSE data, since the beginning of the year, non-residents have been net purchasers of bonds to the value of around R6 billion, but net sellers of South African equities to the value of around R20 billion. The domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated further.   Annual economic growth of 1,3 per cent in 2015 was in line with the Bank’s expectations, but the forecasts for 2016 and 2017 have been revised down from 0,9 per cent and 1,6 per cent, to 0,8 per cent and 1,4 per cent.   Growth of 1,8 per cent is forecast for 2018.   The potential output growth estimate remains unchanged at 1,5 per cent, rising to 1,8 per cent by 2018.   The weak growth trend remains consistent with the Bank’s leading business cycle indicator which declined further in December.   Although the RMB/BER business confidence index was unchanged in the first quarter, it remained at its 5-year low, and masked a collapse in the manufacturing confidence index. 5          The GDP slowdown was fairly broad-based, with contractions in the agriculture, manufacturing and transport and communications sectors.   The outlook for the first quarter for mining and manufacturing is constrained, following sharply negative growth rates in both sectors in January, particularly in mining.   Although the Barclays PMI increased marginally in February, it remained below the neutral 50-level for the seventh consecutive month, and capacity utilisation in the sector also remains relatively low.   The continuing drought also points to an unfavourable outlook for the agricultural sector. While growth in expenditure on gross fixed capital formation improved in the final quarter of 2015, it remains low at an annual growth rate of 1,4 per cent.   Although capital expenditure by the private sector turned positive in the fourth quarter, it was concentrated in the renewable energy sector, while in most other sectors, real capital investment contracted.   These growth and investment trends create an unfavourable climate for making inroads into the unemployment rate which increased marginally to 24,5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 24,3 per cent a year earlier. Growth in consumption expenditure by households increased in the final quarter of 2015, but at 1,6 per cent was still at relatively low levels.   While retail sales growth on a year-on-year basis was fairly resilient, the consecutive month-to-month contractions in real retail trade sales growth in December and January could signal further pressures on consumption expenditure, consistent with the low levels of consumer confidence.   Total new vehicle sales continue to decline, although more positively, there was strong vehicle export growth in February. A number of factors are expected to constrain consumption expenditure despite the persistence of wage and salary increases in excess of inflation.   These factors 6          include rising inflation and higher interest rates; high levels of household debt; and negative wealth effects from low or negative asset price growth.   Furthermore, credit extension to households by the banking sector remains subdued, in contrast to the more vibrant growth in credit extension to the corporate sector, particularly with respect to mortgage advances on commercial properties and renewable energy investments. The recent budget tabled in parliament provides for a fiscal consolidation path which sees the consolidated government budget deficit declining from an estimated 3,2 per cent of GDP in 2016/17 to 2,4 per cent in 2018/19.   This is expected to be achieved through a combination of a lower expenditure ceiling and increased tax revenues.   This path, if realised, can be expected to moderate inflation somewhat while improving South Africa’s credit metrics and confidence in general. Food price pressures, driven by the drought and the depreciated exchange rate, have intensified by more than previously forecast and remain a significant upside risk to inflation.   Manufactured food price inflation measured 7,8 per cent in the PPI, while agricultural prices increased by 25,9 per cent, with cereals and other crops increasing by 79,2 per cent.   These increases are expected to impact with a lag on consumer prices.   Annual CPI food price inflation is now expected to peak at 11,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2016, compared with 11,3 per cent previously. International oil prices have recovered somewhat from their lows of below US dollar 30 per barrel seen in January, as the global oversupply appears to have subsided in the wake of production cut-backs in a number of countries.   Although the Bank has reduced its oil price assumption for the forecast period, it still assumes an upward trajectory as in the previous forecast.   However, there is some upside risk to this 7          forecast, should some agreement on an output freeze be reached by some of the larger producers.   The domestic petrol price was reduced by about 69 cents per litre earlier this month, to its lowest level since March 2015.   However, the current under- recovery, driven mainly by higher international product prices, suggests that this decline could be substantially reversed in April.   This increase will be in addition to the 30 cent per litre increase in the fuel levy announced in the budget. Although the inflation forecast has improved moderately since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the committee remains concerned about the protracted nature of the breach of the target.   Furthermore, the committee assesses the risks to the forecast to be on the upside.   The main risk factors relate to the exchange rate and food prices.   The exchange rate of the rand continues to be highly volatile and vulnerable to changes in both domestic and external developments.   While the pass-through from the exchange to inflation is still relatively low, there are signs that this may be increasing. Food prices have been accelerating faster than previously expected, due to the weaker exchange rate and the intensification of the drought, resulting in an upward revision to the food price forecast.   The Committee views the risks to this forecast to be on the upside, particularly for 2017 when fairly strong favourable base effects are expected.   A more protracted drought, combined with a weaker exchange rate and restocking of herds, may keep food price inflation elevated for a longer period than currently forecast.   The Committee also assesses the risks to the international oil price assumption to be on the upside. The MPC is cognisant of the fact that demand pressures on inflation remain subdued, and indications are that household consumption expenditure is likely to 8     remain constrained.   Nevertheless the recent increase in core inflation and its expected upward trend is indicative of broader inflation pressures and possible second-round effects from supply side shocks.   While the evolution of inflation expectations is critical in this regard, at this stage there is no clear evidence of a deterioration in longer-term inflation expectations, but they remain at an elevated level. The Committee remains concerned about the weak growth outlook amid negative business and consumer confidence.   The growth challenges facing the economy are compounded by the deteriorating outlook for global growth.   The committee assesses the risk to the growth outlook to be on the downside. Given the upside risks to the inflation forecast and the protracted period of the expected breach, the MPC decided that further tightening was required to complement the previous moves.   Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7,00 per cent per annum, effective from 18 March 2016.   Three members favoured a 25 basis point increase while three members preferred no change.   Ultimately the committee decided on an increase. The Committee faced the continuing dilemma of a deteriorating inflation environment and a worsening growth outlook.   The MPC remains sensitive to the possible negative effects of policy tightening on cyclical growth, but will remain focused on its mandate of maintaining price stability. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR

 19 May 2016 

 South African Reserve Bank Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank South Africa’s inflation and growth dynamics continue to highlight the policy dilemma facing monetary policy.   Although headline CPI inflation has moderated since February, the respite is expected to be temporary, as food and petrol price pressures continue to intensify.   The recovery in the rand exchange rate in April also proved to be short-lived, as both domestic and external factors weighed on the currency.   At the same time, domestic economic growth continues to disappoint.   While there are signs that the economy may be reaching the low point in the growth cycle, the recovery is expected to be slow with downside risks.   Global economic growth and financial market conditions have stabilised somewhat since the previous MPC meeting, but a high degree of risk and uncertainty persists. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas has moderated after reaching a recent high of 7,0 per cent in February.   In March and April, CPI inflation measured 6,3 per cent and 6,2 per cent.   Food price pressures continued unabated, with food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerating to 11,0 per cent in April, up from 9,5 per cent previously.   Goods price inflation moderated from 6,9 per cent to 6,7 per cent, while services price inflation 1 was unchanged at 5,7 per cent.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,5 per cent, up from 5,4 per cent in March.   While the impact of the weaker exchange rate remains relatively low, there are indications of increased pass-through in some categories, particularly new motor vehicles and appliances. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods moderated significantly from 8,1 per cent in February to 7,1 per cent in March, mainly as a result of a sharp fall in fuel prices.   Manufactured food product price inflation accelerated to 10,5 per cent, with the category of food, beverages and tobacco products contributing 3,1 percentage points to the March outcome.   Agricultural prices increased by 23,1 per cent in March, with cereal and other crop prices increasing by 50,0 per cent year-on- year. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a moderate near-term deterioration compared with the previous forecast, but there is some improvement in the medium- term outlook.   The breach of the upper end of the target range, while still protracted, is now slightly shorter, with inflation expected to fall within the range during the third quarter of 2017.   Inflation is now expected to average 6,7 per cent in 2016 compared with 6,6 per cent previously.   In 2017 and 2018 inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent and 5,4 per cent, marginally down from the previous forecast.   The expected peak, at 7,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, is unchanged.   The downward revisions are due in part to the higher interest rate assumption, a slightly less depreciated exchange rate assumption, a wider output gap and a lower electricity price assumption.   These pressures are counteracted to some extent by a higher 2 near-term food price forecast, and the impact of upward revisions to the international oil price assumptions. The forecast for core inflation is slightly improved, with a lower forecast for 2016 of 5,9 per cent from 6,2 per cent previously.   Forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are unchanged at 5,7 per cent and 5,2 per cent.   Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the third quarter of 2016 for four consecutive quarters, with a peak of 6,2 per cent (previously 6,5 per cent) in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. The BER survey of inflation expectations is only due for release in July.   The median expectations of economic analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in May are more or less unchanged compared with the previous survey, and are slightly higher than those of the Bank for 2016 and 2017.   In the latest survey, the median expectations for 2016 and 2017 were 6,7 per cent and 6,4 per cent, with inflation expected to be within the target range in 2018, at an average of 5,7 per cent.   Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting and remain at fairly elevated levels. Global growth remains hesitant following a disappointing first quarter in the US and the UK in particular.   While labour market conditions in the US have improved, low corporate profits have constrained investment.   However, consensus forecasts show that a moderate improvement is expected in the coming months, but at a lower rate than previously expected.   The outlook for the UK is clouded by the possibility of an exit from the EU, while the prospects for the Japanese economy remain uncertain.   By contrast, the growth outlook in the euro area is more promising, driven by 3 improvements in Germany and France in particular, although there are concerns that the recent momentum may be fading. Divergent prospects are evident in the emerging markets.   Russia and Brazil remain in recession, but there are signs of some stabilisation in China, as the economy appears to be responding to government policy initiatives.   This improvement, along with a weaker US dollar, has resulted in some recovery in commodity prices, as well as a pick-up in portfolio flows to emerging markets.   Of some concern is the persistent deterioration in growth forecasts for sub-Saharan Africa, which includes some of South Africa’s important trading partners.   The region is now expected to underperform the global economy in 2016, for the first time in 16 years, as the effects of lower commodity prices and drought take their toll. Global inflation pressures remain benign, with low energy prices still having an impact, although this effect is likely to dissipate with the recent upward trend in oil prices.   The latest data show declining prices in the euro area and Japan, and low inflation in the US and the UK.   Inflation has remained relatively higher in a number of Latin American economies, particularly those experiencing currency depreciation.   As a result of these trends, asynchronous monetary policies persist.   While policies are generally accommodative amid subdued growth, particularly in many advanced economies, a number of emerging markets have maintained a tightening bias in response to inflation pressures.   The US Fed is expected to continue with its slow pace of policy rate normalisation but there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the next increase. The rand exchange rate has remained volatile, and following a few weeks of relative strength, has resumed a weakening path and continues to pose an upside risk to the 4 inflation outlook.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has traded in a range between R14,20 and R15,90 against the US dollar, and has depreciated by 1,5 per cent against the dollar, by 0,9 per cent against the euro, and by 1,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. During this period the rand was initially favourably impacted by improved commodity prices, the narrower trade balance, and expectations of a slower pace of US Fed monetary policy tightening.   However, these gains were reversed as global growth concerns resurfaced in early May, and other domestic factors, including the low growth outlook, concerns about a possible ratings downgrade and more recently heightened political uncertainty impacted adversely on the currency. Although the capital flow environment for emerging markets has improved recently, this has not applied to equity flows.   South Africa’s experience has mirrored this, but with stronger equity outflows.   According to the JSE, since the beginning of the year, net sales of domestic equities by non-residents have amounted to R56 bn.   By contrast, non-residents have been net purchasers of domestic government bonds (year-to-date R23 bn), although the past two weeks has seen net sales. The domestic economic growth outlook remains weak, with the Bank’s GDP growth forecast for 2016 revised down from 0,8 per cent to 0,6 per cent.   While a recovery is still expected in the next two years, the forecasts for both these years have been revised down by 0,1 percentage point to 1,3 per cent and 1,7 per cent.   With the estimates of potential output unchanged, the output gap is expected to widen over the forecast period.   The Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity continued its downward trajectory in February, consistent with the constrained outlook. 5 Recent high-frequency data paint a particularly bleak picture of the first quarter of this year, following a sharp contraction in mining output, minimal growth in the manufacturing sector, and declines in electricity production and consumption.   While the Bank’s forecast for GDP growth in the quarter is barely positive, it does represent the low point of the forecast, and a slow upward trend is expected going forward.   This view is consistent with the favourable developments in the Barclays PMI which has recovered fairly strongly, to above the neutral 50-level for the past two months.   The real value of building plans passed, particularly non-residential, increased markedly on a 3-month-to-3-month basis, indicative perhaps of some life in the construction sector, despite very low levels of business confidence in the sector. However, while the recent modest recovery in commodity prices may impact positively on mining output, prices remain low and the sector remains beset by higher input costs and regulatory uncertainty.   The continuing drought is also expected to put further strain on the agricultural sector. The economic slowdown is also reflected in labour market trends, with the unemployment rate rising to 26,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2016, from 26,4 per cent a year earlier.   Although employment growth was positive over the year to the first quarter, the year-on-year growth rate moderated significantly, with employment losses recorded in a number of sectors including manufacturing, agriculture and transport. Household consumption expenditure also remains subdued, with low growth in retail sales in the first quarter.   While there was a welcome increase in exports, new vehicle sales also continue to decline.   The FNB/BER consumer confidence index recovered 6 to some extent in the first quarter of the year, although it still remains at depressed levels, and indicates a low willingness to spend and utilise credit among consumers. The constrained outlook for household consumption expenditure is indicative of the absence of demand pressures in the economy.   This is also confirmed in the weak wealth effects and the continued slow pace of credit extension to households.   Although some improvement has been seen in this regard, growth remains negative in real terms, and is mainly related to mortgage advances and general loans, particularly unsecured lending.   Growth in credit extension to corporates remains strong, but moderated in March. Wage growth appears to be moderating, with growth in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector declining to below 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to lower private sector remuneration growth.   Once adjusting for labour productivity, growth in unit labour costs remained unchanged at 5,0 per cent in that quarter. Food prices remain a significant risk to the inflation outlook in the face of persistent drought and exchange rate weakness.   These pressures are evident in both the consumer price and producer price indices.   Although for some time the MPC had been expecting an acceleration in food price inflation, the recent increases have surprised on the upside, and more aggressive food price increases are now forecast for the near term.   The Bank now expects food price inflation to peak at around 12 per cent in the final quarter of this year.   However, should food prices stabilise or decline later in the year, there is the potential for downside base effects next year.   Futures prices suggest that both maize and wheat prices are expected to remain 7 elevated for the rest of the year, reinforced by a sizeable increase in the domestic wheat import tariff. The international oil price assumptions in the forecasting model have been increased, with the price of Brent crude oil remaining firmly above the US dollar 40 per barrel level since the second week of April.   Demand has surprised on the upside, and, despite an increase in supply from Iran, output has declined in a number of countries.   This upward price trend may, however, be contained by high levels of inventories.   Domestic petrol prices have increased by a cumulative R1,00 per litre since March, mainly due to higher international prices and an increase in the fuel levy.   Should current exchange rate and international oil price trends persist, a further significant increase can be expected in June. The MPC faced the continuing dilemma of upside risks to the inflation forecast and a worsening growth outlook.   The risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside, particularly in the short term, despite the downward revision to the forecast.   Both the mining and agricultural sectors are expected to weigh heavily on the first quarter growth outcome, and the outlook is therefore dependent in part on whether these sectors rebound in the coming quarters. The Committee remains concerned about the inflation outlook and the extended breach of the target.   Although the inflation forecast has shown a moderate improvement over the medium term, the risks are still assessed to be on the upside.   The exchange rate remains highly sensitive to domestic political developments and risks of an earlier-than-expected tightening in US monetary policy.   The exchange rate implicit in the forecast is stronger than the current level, imparting a significant degree of upside risk.   While pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation 8 remains relatively subdued, there are indications that this may be increasing.   There is also some upside risk to the international oil price assumption. The Committee remains concerned that inflation expectations remain at uncomfortably high levels.   Although core inflation has remained relatively contained in recent months, with a lower peak now expected, it is forecast to accelerate and exceed the upper end of the inflation target range for four quarters in response to exchange rate and wage pressures. Some countervailing risks are also evident.   While there is a risk that food prices may accelerate faster in the near term, the longer term forecast assumes that food prices will stabilise by year end, allowing for favourable base effects next year.   However, should food prices, particularly grains, decline in response to a normalisation of weather patterns, a much sharper downward food inflation trajectory could transpire.   The absence of demand pressures, and risks to consumption expenditure growth may also contribute to downside risks. The increase in the repo rate at the previous MPC meeting contributed to the improvement in the longer-term inflation forecast, and that move should be seen in conjunction with previous actions in the cycle and the lagged effects of monetary policy.   The MPC felt that there is some room to pause in this tightening cycle and accordingly decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now at 7,0 per cent per annum.   Five members preferred no change, while one member preferred a 25 basis point increase. The MPC remains focused on its inflation mandate, but sensitive to the extent possible to the state of the economy.   The MPC will not hesitate to act appropriately 9 should the inflation dynamics require a response, within a flexible inflation targeting framework.   Future moves, as before, will continue to be highly data dependent. Lesetja Kganyago Governor

 21 July 2016 

 South African Reserve Bank Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The UK vote to leave the European Union has dominated the global landscape in the past month.   The outlook for the global economy has become more uncertain as the potential consequences of these developments are being assessed.   The lack of clarity regarding the process going forward has had significant implications for global growth and interest rates as the prospects for further near-term monetary policy tightening by the US Fed recede.   While there have been spillovers to the South African financial markets, particularly the exchange rate, the direct short-term impact on South African growth and trade is likely to be fairly limited.   Domestic growth has surprised further on the downside, and the outlook remains constrained.   At the same time domestic inflation outcomes have surprised marginally on the downside, but an extended breach of the target is still expected. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6,1 per cent in May, before rising to 6,3 per cent in June.   Food price inflation measured 11,0 per cent in June, below the recent peak of 11,3 per cent in April, and was marginally negative on a month-on-month basis.   Goods 1      price inflation measured 6,7 per cent, up from 6,6 per cent in May, while services increased by 5,8 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent in May.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,6 per cent, up from 5,5 per cent previously. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods continued its downward trend, declining from 7,0 per cent in April to 6,5 per cent in May mainly due to a further moderation in price inflation of food, beverages and tobacco products.   This was below the consensus forecast of 6,9 per cent.   The impact of the drought is still evident in the increase in prices of agricultural products, particularly cereals and other crops as well as live animals and animal products. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a marginal improvement compared with the previous forecast.   Nevertheless, inflation is still expected to accelerate further this year and is only expected to return to within the target range of 3-6 per cent during the third quarter of 2017.   Inflation is now expected to average 6,6 per cent in 2016 and 6,0 per cent in 2017, compared with 6,7 per cent and 6,2 per cent previously.   In 2018 inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent, marginally up from the previous forecast.   The expected peak, at 7,1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, is down from 7,3 per cent.   The downward revisions are due in part to lower administered price inflation (mainly petrol), despite a small upward adjustment in the international oil price assumption. The forecast for core inflation is lower than the previous forecast in the near term, mainly due to the lower starting point, but higher in the outer period.   Core inflation is expected to moderate from an average of 5,8 per cent in 2016 to 5,3 per cent by 2018.   Whereas previously core inflation was expected to breach the upper end of the 2          target range in the third quarter of 2016 for four consecutive quarters, a one-quarter breach, at 6,1 per cent, is now expected in the fourth quarter of this year. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research have remained relatively anchored at the upper end of the inflation target range.   In the second quarter, average expectations for 2016 were 6,3 per cent, up from 6,2 per cent.   Average expectations for 2017 were unchanged at 6,2 per cent and were marginally down to 5,9 per cent for 2018.   Expectations of business people were more or less unchanged compared to the previous quarter.   Both analysts and trade union officials revised up their near-term forecasts, while forecasts for 2018 were revised lower.   Average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 6,1 per cent to 5,9 per cent in the second quarter, with downward revisions by all groups. The median expectations of market analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in July, show a moderate decline since May.   Inflation expectations declined from 6,7 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2016 and 2017, to 6,6 per cent and 6,1 per cent.   The yield differential between inflation linked bonds and conventional government bonds (break-even inflation expectations) declined across all maturities but remain elevated. The global economic outlook has been influenced by the outcome of the UK referendum.   The financial markets displayed a high degree of volatility in the immediate aftermath of the outcome, but have stabilised to some extent since then.   Nevertheless the longer term real impacts are expected to be negative for global growth, particularly for the UK and Europe, as investment decisions are put on hold during the transition period.   A high degree of uncertainty is expected to persist for 3          some time as the magnitude of this slowdown is still unclear and dependent on the nature and speed of the UK disengagement.   Since the referendum, global growth forecasts have generally been revised down. The outlook for emerging markets has remained relatively subdued, with further downside risks in Turkey following the recent coup attempt and terrorist attacks.   Recent outcomes in China indicate some improvement in the growth prospects in response to government stimulus packages, and this has underpinned a stabilisation and moderate upward trend in commodity prices.   The IMF growth forecasts released earlier this week have revised sub-Saharan African growth downwards.   The region has been negatively impacted by lower commodity prices and severe drought in some parts. Inflation in the advanced economies remains low and still generally below target.   The Brexit vote has also modified expectations regarding monetary policy in these economies.   Although the Bank of England kept policy rates on hold at its most recent meeting, expectations are for a reduction in the policy rate in the near future, with the prospect of a resumption of quantitative easing.   Markets are now expecting the US policy rate to remain unchanged for some time.   At the same time, the highly accommodative monetary policy stances of the ECB and Bank of Japan are expected to persist, with the possibility of additional stimulus. These developments have reinforced the global search for yield, as yield curves flattened across major advanced economy markets.   The number of government bonds trading with negative yields increased further.   This has provided additional impetus to renewed capital flows to emerging markets observed since earlier this 4          year.   While these flows are expected to persist, they remain sensitive to changes in expectations regarding US monetary policy and general global risk perceptions. The recent volatility experienced by the rand exchange rate has been driven mainly by external factors and changes in global risk perceptions.   Although the rand depreciated sharply in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, it has reversed these losses, and more so against the British pound.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has traded in a range of R15,80 and R14,22 against the US dollar, and has appreciated by 11,0 per cent against the US dollar, by 12,9 per cent against the euro and by 23,0 per cent against sterling.   On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has appreciated by 12,2 per cent. The rand has been supported by the global search for yield.   There was a sharp increase in non-resident inflows to the domestic bond and equity markets in June and July.   Since the beginning of June, net purchases by non-residents of R107,3 billion have been recorded.   The rand also responded positively to the improvement in commodity prices, and the unexpectedly large trade surplus recorded in May which followed a small surplus in April.   Despite this recent strength, the rand remains vulnerable to possible “risk-off” global scenarios; changes in US monetary policy expectations; and domestic concerns including the possibility of ratings downgrades later in the year. The domestic economic growth outlook remains extremely challenging, following the contraction in GDP in the first quarter of this year.   Although this is anticipated to have been the low point of the cycle, the recovery is expected to be weak.   The Bank’s latest forecast is for zero per cent growth in 2016, compared with 0,6 per cent previously.   Growth rates of 1,1 per cent and 1,5 per cent are forecast for the next 5          two years, down from 1,3 per cent and 1,7 per cent previously.   The Bank’s estimate of potential output has been revised down marginally to 1,4 per cent in 2016, rising to 1,7 per cent in 2018.   This growth outlook is corroborated by the persistent negative trend in the Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity.   Business confidence remains low with the RMB/BER business confidence indicator falling to its lowest level since 2009 in the second quarter of this year. Recent economic data suggest that positive growth was recorded in the second quarter, with the mining and manufacturing sectors expected to add positively to growth.   The more positive trend in manufacturing is consistent with the Barclays PMI which has been above the neutral 50 level since March.   The BER manufacturing confidence index also improved, but still remains at low levels.   The real value of building plans passed is indicative of some improvement in the sector, particularly with respect to residential construction.   However, this is not reflected in the FNB/BER building confidence index which declined further in the second quarter. Underlying the negative performance of the economy during the first quarter was the sharp contraction in growth in gross fixed capital formation for the second consecutive quarter, by both the private sector and general government.   These trends have contributed to the persistence of high rates of unemployment in the economy.   Although formal non-agricultural employment increased in the first quarter of 2016, this was largely due to temporary employment opportunities created by the Independent Electoral Commission.   By contrast, private sector employment contracted during the first quarter. Growth in consumption expenditure by households also contracted in the first quarter, with a sharp slowdown in expenditure on durable goods in particular.   The 6          FNB/BER consumer confidence index declined in the second quarter to low levels, following a moderate improvement in the previous quarter.   The BER retail confidence index also declined sharply in the second quarter.   While new vehicle sales remained weak, vehicle exports recorded strong growth in the second quarter. Despite the surprise increase in retail and wholesale trade sales in May, consumption expenditure by households is expected to remain subdued given the low consumer confidence, high debt levels, rising costs of debt servicing, and slow employment growth.   Consumption expenditure has been further constrained by the absence of significant wealth effects owing to the weak performance of asset markets, particularly the housing market.   Credit extension to households also remains weak, with negative real rates of growth.   Average wage growth has remained relatively stable, but there are risks of increases in excess of inflation and productivity gains. There are as yet no clear signs of a recovery in the agricultural sector, and food price inflation is expected to remain elevated for some time.   The Bank expects food price inflation to peak at 12,6 per cent during the final quarter of this year.   There are some encouraging signs of moderation in some food categories at both the producer and consumer price levels, and futures prices of grains have declined markedly.   Should food prices stabilise or decline in the coming months, there is the potential for significant downside base effects next year.   Exchange rate developments will also be critical in this respect, as will global food prices, which have reversed their recent negative trend. Despite supply disruptions and curtailments by a number of producers, the price of Brent crude oil has mostly traded within a band of US dollar 45 and US dollar 50 since the 7          previous meeting of the MPC.   The Bank’s model assumes a very moderate upward trend in oil prices over the forecast period, but there may be a degree of downside risk in the short term, with some upside risk in the outer period as global demand recovers.   The domestic petrol price increased by a cumulative 60 cents per litre in the past two months, due to both the exchange rate and international prices.   However, the recent appreciation of the rand coupled with a lower average oil price has resulted in a substantial over-recovery in the petrol price, and a sizeable reduction in retail prices is expected in August. The Monetary Policy Committee remains concerned about the weak economic growth outlook and the medium term inflation trajectory which remains outside the target range of 3 to 6 per cent until the second half of next year.   Nevertheless there have been some improvements in the near term inflation prospects following successive downside surprises.   This is also the case for core inflation, where the expected breach of the upper end of the target range is now less protracted.   While the risks to the inflation forecast are assessed to remain on the upside, these risks have moderated somewhat. Global uncertainties appear to have delayed monetary policy tightening in advanced economies.   The impact of the more appreciated rand exchange rate on the inflation outlook will depend to a large extent on whether the exchange rate is sustained at these stronger levels.   Current exchange rate levels are stronger than those implicit in the forecast, providing some buffer to the projections.   The rand remains sensitive to both domestic and external developments, and the recent trends can be quickly reversed. 8          The outlook is clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the longer term market and global growth implications of Brexit.   The implications for the rand and domestic growth, and ultimately inflation, could vary quite significantly depending on which scenario plays out. A weaker global growth scenario could also imply that there may be a degree of downside risk to the international oil price assumption, which was adjusted upward.   A combination of a stronger exchange rate and subdued international oil prices would have a favourable impact on domestic petrol prices in the coming months.   However, the committee assesses the longer term risk to this assumption to be on the upside, as global growth and oil demand are expected to recover. Food prices remain an upside risk in the near term.   There could however be a sharp decline in agricultural prices next year should favourable weather patterns transpire as forecast.   The absence of demand pressures and weak consumption expenditure growth may also contribute to downside risks. While the committee remains concerned about the overall inflation trajectory, the assessment of the balance of risks to the inflation outlook and the weak domestic economy has provided some room to delay further tightening of the monetary policy stance for now.   Accordingly the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC is aware that some of the favourable factors that contributed to this decision could reverse quickly, and remains ready to react appropriately to any significant change in the inflation outlook. 9     Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR

 22 September 2016

 South African Reserve Bank Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Headline consumer price inflation declined to within the target range of 3 to 6 per cent in August, in line with the Reserve Bank’s expectations.   Nevertheless, higher inflation outcomes are forecast in the near-term before a sustained return to within the target range during 2017.   While domestic economic growth prospects appear more favourable following the positive surprise in the second quarter of this year, the outlook remains constrained against a backdrop of weak domestic fixed investment and low levels of business and consumer confidence. Risks from the global environment persist, although the volatility in global financial markets in the wake of the Brexit decision has subsided.   Prospects for a resumption of US monetary policy tightening remain a key risk to the pattern of global capital flows and to emerging market exchange rates in general, with continued uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of future moves. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,0 per cent and 5,9 per cent in July and August respectively, 1        down from 6,3 per cent in June.   Food price inflation in August accelerated to a recent high of 11,6 per cent, with the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing 1,7 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome.   Goods price inflation measured 6,1 per cent in August, down from 6,5 per cent in July, while services price inflation was unchanged at 5,7 per cent.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity was also unchanged at 5,7 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased in June and July to 6,8 per cent and 7,4 per cent respectively, following a decline to 6,5 per cent in May.   This acceleration was mainly due to the impact of the drought on manufactured food price inflation, which measured 12,6 per cent in July.   This was its highest level since January 2009.   Producer price inflation for agricultural products also remained elevated at around 20 per cent. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank has improved over the first four quarters of the forecast horizon, and remains more or less unchanged for the rest of the period.   Inflation is expected to peak at 6,7 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, compared with 7,1 per cent previously, with an earlier sustained return to within the target range now forecast to occur during the second quarter of 2017.   Inflation is expected to average 6,4 per cent in 2016 and 5,8 per cent in 2017, compared with 6,6 per cent and 6,0 per cent previously.   The forecast for 2018 is unchanged at an average of 5,5 per cent.   The downward revisions are due in part to a lower starting point, lower administered price inflation assumptions (including petrol, electricity and rates and taxes inflation), as well as a less depreciated exchange rate assumption. 2          Compared with the previous forecast, core inflation is expected to average 0,1 percentage point less, at 5,7 per cent and 5,6 per cent in 2016 and 2017, and is unchanged at 5,3 per cent in 2018.   Core inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, with a peak of 5,9 per cent in the final quarter of this year. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research have remained relatively unchanged, but with some changes between the different groups of respondents.   Average inflation expectations declined by 0,2 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2017, and remained unchanged at 5,9 per cent for 2018.   While expectations of both analysts and business people declined, those of trade union officials remained unchanged for 2017 but increased for 2018.   The long- term 5-year-ahead inflation expectations are unchanged at 5,9 per cent and remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. Inflation expectations of analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey have also shown successive declines during the past few months, with the median expectation for inflation to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2017.   Longer-term expectations of market participants implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds) declined further since the previous meeting of the MPC, although they remain above the upper end of the inflation target range. The global growth outlook remains subdued, amid slowing growth in the advanced economies and a general downward revision to forecasts.   Although prospects for the US economy remain relatively favourable, outcomes have not been consistently positive, as evidenced by the recent weak consumer expenditure and manufacturing 3          sector data.   Nevertheless, labour market conditions have improved and the investment slowdown appears to have bottomed. Although the short term impacts of Brexit on the UK economy have not been as negative as initially feared, growth forecasts have been revised down as concerns remain regarding the longer term investment outlook.   The euro area recovery remains steady but subdued.   The Japanese economy remains caught in a deflation and low growth bind, following a weak second quarter. The recent firmer trend in commodity prices has improved growth prospects for commodity-producing emerging markets in particular, along with more favourable capital inflows.   It is unclear how long these positive developments will continue.   Indications are that the negative growth cycles in both Russia and Brazil have turned, and both countries are expected to record positive, but weak rates of growth in the near term.   The Chinese economy appears to have stabilised following concerns about a slowdown earlier in the year, but concerns regarding the financial sector persist. Given the broadly benign global inflation environment, apart from in some emerging markets, monetary policies have generally remained accommodative, with further loosening or a loosening bias in a number of the advanced economies.   A notable exception is the United States where the bias remains for a resumption of interest rate normalisation, but the timing remains uncertain.   Following the decision of the Fed to keep rates unchanged yesterday, the market expectation is for the next move to be in December.   The data-dependent nature of future decisions means that these prospects are likely to change with new data releases, imparting a degree of volatility 4          to financial markets and to global capital flows.   The US policy rate trajectory is still expected to be moderate. The rand exchange rate has been affected by these global events, but has also been impacted by domestic fundamentals and political developments.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand traded in a range of R14,73 and R13,28 against the US dollar and has appreciated by 6,3 per cent against the US dollar, by 4,3 per cent against the euro, and by 5,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand initially appreciated markedly in line with other emerging market currencies as the chances of US Fed tightening receded in August following disappointing labour market data.   At that stage the rand recorded its strongest level since October 2015.   This trend was reversed following increased domestic risk perceptions, which were also reflected in rising domestic government bond yields.   More recently, the rand has been positively impacted by the stronger GDP growth outcome, and a significant narrowing of the current account deficit, following a sizeable trade account surplus in the second quarter.   Although this may reflect in part a delayed adjustment to the depreciated rand exchange rate, the trade surplus is not expected to be sustained at similar levels in the coming months. The marked appreciation of the rand during the past few days appears to be driven by expectations of unchanged US monetary policy, as well as to speculation regarding possible purchases of rand related to a major M&A transaction.   The rand, however, remains vulnerable to future changes in the US monetary policy stance, domestic political developments as well as to a risk of a possible ratings downgrade later in the year.   Nevertheless, the upside risk to inflation from the exchange rate appears to have moderated somewhat. 5          The domestic economy remains weak despite the positive growth surprise in the second quarter of 2016, when an annualised growth rate of 3,3 per cent was recorded.   This was driven by a rebound in the primary sector, and a surge in real exports.   Mainly as a result of the higher starting point, the Bank’s forecast for economic growth for 2016 has been revised upward from zero per cent to 0,4 per cent.   The forecasts for the next two years have been increased marginally by 0,1 percentage points, to 1,2 per cent and 1,6 per cent respectively.   Estimates of potential output growth are unchanged, implying a persistence of below-potential growth.   The trend in the Bank’s composite leading indicator of economic activity remains indicative of subdued growth. While the second quarter growth performance was more favourable, data for July suggest that this improvement is unlikely to be sustained in the third quarter.   Both the mining and manufacturing sectors recorded negative month-to-month growth rates in July, and the Barclays PMI declined sharply in August following five consecutive months above the neutral 50-point mark.   Stresses are also evident in the construction sector with a further sharp decline in building plans passed during July. A key constraint to the growth outlook remains the sluggish state of domestic gross fixed capital formation, which contributed negatively to GDP growth during the first two quarters of this year.   In the second quarter of 2016, domestic fixed investment contracted in both the private and public sectors (including government and public corporations).   Private sector fixed investment has recorded negative or zero growth for six consecutive quarters, reflecting low levels of business confidence.   The RMB/BER business confidence index remains below the neutral level, despite an improvement in the third quarter. 6          This adverse investment climate and rising costs have contributed to the further deterioration in employment prospects in the mining and manufacturing sectors in particular.   The official unemployment rate increased to 26,6 per cent in the second quarter, from 25,0 per cent a year earlier.   The increase in employment that was recorded in the second quarter was almost entirely attributable to temporary employment opportunities related to the municipal elections. Consumption expenditure by households remains weak, despite a return to positive growth following the first quarter contraction.   The annualised growth of 1,0 per cent suggests that consumers remain under pressure.   Durable goods consumption continued to contract in the second quarter and is consistent with the further decline in the FNB/BER consumer confidence index.   In July, retail trade sales declined further, in contrast to positive wholesale trade sales.   Domestic new vehicle sales continued their negative trend in July and August, while exports of motor vehicles have remained robust. The outlook for consumption expenditure growth is expected to remain constrained, given the unfavourable employment outlook, the absence of significant positive wealth effects, and the slow pace of growth of real disposable income of households.   Average wage growth and wage settlement rates have declined slightly, but there are risks of increases in excess of inflation and productivity gains. Credit extension to households continues to contract in real terms, likely driven by both the supply and demand side considerations.   However, there has been a moderate increase in mortgage credit extension.   As before, growth in credit extension to the corporate sector has been more resilient, but below its recent peaks. 7          Food prices remain a significant driver of inflation given the persistent drought, although long-range weather forecasts suggest improved rainfall prospects in the coming months.   Food price inflation is still expected to reach a peak in the fourth quarter of this year, at around 12,3 per cent, slightly lower than in the previous forecast.   Spot and futures prices of wheat and maize have declined in recent weeks, but meat prices are expected to rise further as farmers restock their herds.   Global food price inflation has increased, mainly due to an acceleration in the price of sugar. International oil prices have fluctuated between US dollar 40-US dollar 50 per barrel for the past six months, amid uncertainty relating to a possible supply freeze by OPEC.   The assumption for Brent crude oil in the Bank’s forecasting model is unchanged, and assumes a moderate increase over the forecast period.   After two consecutive months of price declines totalling R1,17 per litre, the domestic petrol price is expected to increase in October, due to adverse movements in the both the exchange rate and international product prices. The Monetary Policy Committee has noted improvements in the expected inflation trajectory during the course of the year.   Apart from the tighter stance of monetary policy, this has also been driven by lower starting points, as inflation surprised at times on the downside, and changed assumptions underlying the forecast.   The expected peak in headline inflation is notably lower, and an earlier return to within the target range is also expected.   Most of the changes have been for the current and coming year, whereas the changes in the forecast for 2018 have been marginal.   Changes to the core inflation forecast have been less pronounced, but it is no longer expected to breach the upper end of the target range.   Despite these improvements, the longer-term inflation trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range, with high wage settlement rates and inflation expectations contributing to this persistence. 8          The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to be more or less balanced at this stage.   The current level of the rand is stronger than that implicit in the forecast, and, in conjunction with continued low levels of pass-through from the rand to inflation, the risks are assessed to have moderated somewhat.   However, some of the positive factors impacting on the rand may be temporary, and the rand remains vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks. The other major risk to the inflation outlook relates to food prices.   The forecast still expects food prices to peak in the final quarter of this year.   The future trajectory of these prices will be highly dependent on the normalisation of rainfall in the coming months.   Favourable weather patterns could see food price inflation falling faster than that implicit in the forecast. Despite the improved growth performance in the second quarter, the growth outlook remains constrained as reflected in the more or less unchanged outlook for the next two years.   The MPC assesses the risk to the growth forecast to be broadly balanced, and growth prospects remain dependent on global conditions, implementation of structural reforms, as well as changes in business and consumer confidence. Given improvements in the inflation forecast, the weak domestic economic outlook and the assessment of the balance of risks, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains concerned about the overall inflation trajectory which remains in the upper end of the inflation target range. 9       The MPC is of the view that should current forecasts transpire, we may be close to the end of the tightening cycle.   The committee is aware that a number of the favourable factors that have contributed to the improved outlook can change very quickly resulting in a reassessment of this view.   The bar for monetary accommodation, by contrast, remains high, as the MPC would need to see a more significant and sustained decline of the inflation trajectory to within the inflation target range.

  South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the global economic and political landscape has changed significantly following the US presidential election.   The high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic policies of the new administration is expected to persist for some time, creating a more challenging and volatile environment for emerging markets in particular.   Higher US long bond yields, along with expectations of a tighter stance of monetary policy by the US Fed than previously expected, have contributed to the reversal of the recent positive sentiment towards emerging markets.   The prospect of rising protectionism and its implications for world trade are also a concern. These developments have also affected capital flows to South Africa, with implications for the rand and bond yields.   Domestic growth and inflation dynamics have remained more or less in line with expectations, but risks to the inflation outlook have increased moderately. 1      The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,1 per cent and 6,4 per cent in September and October respectively, compared with 5,9 per cent in August.   The October outcome was marginally above the Bank’s forecast.   Food price inflation accelerated further to a recent high of 12,0 per cent, with the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing 1,8 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome.   Goods price inflation measured 7,1 per cent in October, up from 6,6 per cent in September, with non-durable goods inflation increasing to 7,6 per cent.   Services price inflation increased from 5,6 per cent to 5,8 per cent.   The Bank’s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,7 per cent, up from 5,6 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 6,6 per cent in September and October, down from 7,2 per cent in August.   The main contributor to the October outcome was the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 4,0 percentage points, and reflects the continued impact of the drought on food prices. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank is broadly unchanged over the forecast period, despite a moderate upward adjustment to the food price forecast in the later quarters.   The annual averages are unchanged at 6,4 per cent for 2016, and 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent in the coming two years.   Inflation is expected to peak at 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, marginally lower than in the previous forecast, with a sustained return to within the target range still expected to occur 2          during the second quarter of 2017.   The higher food price assumption is offset by a slightly more appreciated exchange rate assumption. Core inflation is expected to average 0,1 percentage point less in each year of the forecast period, compared with the previous forecast, at 5,6 per cent this year, and 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2017 and 2018.   Core inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, with a peak of 5,8 per cent in the final quarter of this year. The annual inflation expectations of economic analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in November, are broadly unchanged since September, and are similar to those of the Bank.   The median forecast for the current and next two years are 6,3 per cent, 5,8 per cent and 5,6 per cent.   Bond market expectations implicit in the breakeven inflation rates, i.e. the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, increased in the wake of the recent depreciation of the rand.   They remain above the upper end of the inflation target range. The global outlook has become increasingly uncertain during the year following the UK decision to leave the European Union, and the outcome of the US presidential election.   While the new policy direction in the US is still unclear, the markets have interpreted the outcome as being positive for US growth in the short run, with commitments to tax cuts and higher fiscal spending on infrastructure.   These policies are expected to result in higher growth and inflation, particularly against the backdrop of an increasingly tight labour market.   Nevertheless, the timing and extent of the expenditure boost is highly uncertain at this stage. 3          While an increase in infrastructure expenditure could be positive for commodity prices, other aspects of the possible new policy direction are likely to have an adverse effect on emerging markets.   These include a possible more aggressive tightening of US monetary policy in response to higher inflation and growth, which could also reduce the multiplier effect of the fiscal expansion.   Together with the recent sharp increase in US long bond yields, the possibility of such actions has led to a reversal of capital flows to emerging markets, reminiscent of the market reaction to the so-called US taper tantrum in 2013.   The impact on emerging market currencies and bond markets, including in South Africa, are already evident.   Given the high degree of uncertainty, the financial markets may have over-reacted. A further concern for emerging markets is the potential change of trade policies that may impact on existing trade treaties, as well as unilateral increases in tariff protection in the US.   The outlook for emerging markets has therefore become more uncertain.   The lingering concerns about the sustainability of the recovery in the Chinese economy have been revived by the possibility of tariff increases on Chinese exports.   Countries with strong direct trade links with the US, in particular Mexico, are most vulnerable to increased trade barriers.   A more protectionist US stance could reinforce the already slow growth of global trade. The short-term fallout of Brexit on the UK economy has been limited to date, due in part to the accommodative monetary policy response.   The longer-term impact remains unclear as the terms of withdrawal are still to be negotiated, and there are concerns that a delay in clarity could undermine investment.   The Eurozone is expected to continue with its slow but steady recovery, and the Japanese economy continues to battle with deflation. 4          Global inflation remains generally benign and since the previous meeting of the MPC a number of countries have loosened monetary policy.   Expansionary policies are expected to persist in the Eurozone, Japan and the UK, despite emerging inflation pressures in the latter.   By contrast, a persistence of significant outflows from emerging markets in response to the possibility of a tighter US monetary policy stance could pose challenges for monetary policies in a number of these economies. These new global developments have impacted on the domestic bond and foreign exchange markets.   The rand appreciated steadily from the middle of October in response to some positive domestic developments, as well as inflows from a large M&A transaction.   The currency was trading at around R13,20 against the US dollar just before the elections.   It then reached its weakest point of R14,60 against the US dollar in the wake of the surprise outcome, before recovering somewhat.   Domestic long bond yields (R186) initially spiked by about 60 basis points, but the increase has since moderated to about 25 basis points.   Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by about 5,7 per cent against the US dollar, and by about 1,1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to changes in the stance of US monetary policy.   A US rate increase is generally expected in December and probably largely priced in, but of greater significance for the rand will be the signals from the FOMC regarding the trajectory of future increases.   The rand will also remain sensitive to the sovereign ratings announcements due later this month and early in December. On the positive side, the rand has been given support by the generally improved trade account in recent months.   However, the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is expected to have widened in the third quarter of this year. 5          The financing of the deficit may become more challenging should the recent significant non-resident sales of bonds and equities persist.   During October and month-to-date, non-residents have been net sellers of domestic bonds and equities to the value of R42,7 bn and R19,7 bn respectively. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued, although the low point of the cycle appears to be behind us.   The Bank’s forecast remains unchanged at 0,4 per cent for 2016, and 1,2 per cent and 1,6 per cent for the next two years.   While the estimate for potential GDP growth was revised down marginally to 1,3 per cent, and rising to 1,5 per cent by 2018, the output gap is expected to remain negative over the forecast period.   The Bank’s composite leading business cycle indicator improved in August and September, continuing a recent generally positive but gradual upward trend. Available monthly data suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be positive but well below the rate recorded in the second quarter.   The mining sector contributed positively to GDP growth in the quarter.   The physical volume of manufacturing output declined, despite a positive month-to-month outcome in September.   The Barclays Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which declined further in October, has remained below the neutral 50 index point level for three consecutive months.   The weak trends in manufacturing are consistent with the continued low levels of business confidence, despite a moderate improvement in the third quarter.   More positively, the services sector is expected to sustain its positive growth rate, with the tourism sector being particularly buoyant. 6          Consumption expenditure by households remains subdued, with declining retail trade sales, and static wholesale trade sales in the third quarter of this year.   Although new motor vehicle sales increased sharply on a month-to-month basis in October, a sizeable proportion of this is attributed to car rental companies, and challenging conditions in the new vehicle sector persist. Consumers continue to face a number of constraints.   Employment growth is particularly weak; household debt levels, while moderating, are still elevated; and wealth effects are muted amid stagnant equity and residential property markets.   Furthermore, growth in credit extension to households remains subdued. Slow growth in household disposable incomes is also reflected in a gradual decline in wage growth, with growth in nominal remuneration per worker declining to 5,8 per cent in the second quarter.   When an adjustment is made for the increase in labour productivity, growth over four quarters in nominal unit labour costs measured 5,1 per cent in the second quarter.   The Andrew Levy Employment Publications Survey reports an average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements of 7,5 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, and 7,1 per cent in the third quarter.   This may be indicative of wage settlements becoming more sensitive to the persistently high unemployment rates. According to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) released in October, fiscal consolidation is set to continue at a measured pace.   A moderate degree of slippage is expected in the near term, as tax receipts are negatively affected by the economic slowdown.   In order to prevent an excessive widening of the fiscal deficit, the MTBPS proposes a reduction in the expenditure ceiling and tax increases to be announced in February.   A revised deficit of 3,4 per cent of GDP is 7          expected in the current fiscal year, and steadily narrowing to 2,5 per cent of GDP in the 2019/20 fiscal year. Food price inflation remains a significant driver of inflation, and is sensitive to the continuing drought.   While food price inflation is still expected to moderate from early 2017, the pace of decline is expected to be slower than previously forecast.   This has led to an upward revision to the food price assumption in the forecast during the outer quarters in particular.   The change is mainly due to the delayed impact of meat prices which are now expected to peak only in early 2018, as farmers rebuild their herds during 2017. Brent crude oil prices reached a year high of US dollar 52 per barrel in early October following the OPEC agreement to curtail production.   Since then, prices have declined following doubts about the prospects for an agreement on the distribution of production cuts across the cartel.   Some price volatility is expected in the short run as negotiations on production cuts continue.   The Bank’s forecast maintains the assumption of a moderate upward trajectory of international oil prices over the forecast period.   The domestic price of 93 octane petrol increased by a cumulative 88 cents per litre in October and November, with almost all of the increase due to higher international product prices.   The current over-recovery indicates that should current trends persist, about half of that increase could be reversed in December. 8          The MPC is of the view that a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the nature and timing of possible policy changes emanating from significant developments in the global economic environment.   This elevated uncertainty creates a more challenging environment especially for emerging markets as evidenced in the recent changed pattern of capital flows.   Financial markets are thus likely to remain volatile for some time. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the inflation forecast has remained largely unchanged.   Whereas the risks to the inflation forecast were previously assessed to be more or less balanced, the Committee now assesses the risks to be moderately to the upside.   This is mainly due to the possible impact of adverse global developments on the exchange rate.   The risk of domestically generated shocks to the exchange rate also remain.   Nevertheless, despite its high degree of volatility, the rand has displayed relative resilience in the face of numerous shocks over the past year. The domestic growth outlook is unchanged and remains constrained against the backdrop of weak business and consumer confidence.   The risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be broadly balanced.   Domestic demand pressures remain weak, and consumers are expected to remain under pressure for some time. The MPC has accordingly decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum.   The decision was unanimous. The MPC remains concerned that the inflation trajectory is uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range.   Furthermore, the uncertain environment and moderately higher risks to the inflation outlook require continued vigilance.   While the 9     Committee retains the view that we may be close to the end of the hiking cycle, there may be a reassessment of this position should the upside risks transpire.
