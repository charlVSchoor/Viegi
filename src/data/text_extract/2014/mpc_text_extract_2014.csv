SARB,1,29/01/2014,"South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the expected cutback in quantitative easing by the US Fed has begun. Although the initial response in global financial markets was generally fairly muted, emerging markets have subsequently experienced a high degree of turbulence, particularly in the wake of renewed fears of a slowdown in China. While the Fed action signals a recovery in the US, and the UK economic outlook is also improving, it does not mean that the global financial crisis is over. Rather, we are now entering a phase of the crisis that is creating new challenges for emerging market economies. In the longer run a sustained recovery in the US should be positive for the global economy in general, but the adjustment to the withdrawal of quantitative easing is likely to create significant short to medium-term challenges. How to respond to a 2 combination of sharply depreciating currencies, capital outflows, slowing growth, rising inflation, significant current account and/or fiscal deficits and deteriorating confidence is posing policy challenges and very difficult trade-offs for many emerging markets. The rand exchange rate has been one of the currencies affected by these developments, and the recent depreciation of the rand, if sustained, will raise significantly the risk to the inflation outlook. Our inflation forecast shows a marked deterioration, despite the absence of clear evidence of domestic demand pressures. The recent inflation data reflects positive outcomes that belie the incipient risks, largely from the depreciation of the currency, that our forecasts highlight. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,3 per cent in November 2013 and 5,4 per cent in December, resulting in an average annual inflation rate of 5,7 per cent for 2013. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation continued to moderate from a recent peak of 7,1 per cent in August, to 3,8 per cent in November and 3,5 per cent in December. The contribution of this category to the average CPI increase was 0,5 percentage points in December compared with 0,6 percentage points in the previous month. The petrol price, which was the main contributor to the higher overall inflation in December, increased at a year-on-year rate of 10,0 per cent, up from 7,7 per cent in November. Core inflation, which excludes food,   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 2 3 petrol and electricity, has been unchanged at 5,3 per cent for the four months to December, while administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,8 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5,8 per cent in November, compared with 6,3 per cent in October. The headline inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC, mainly as a result of revisions to the assumptions regarding the rand exchange rate. The forecast average inflation rate for 2014 is 0,6 percentage points higher at 6,3 per cent, and 0,6 percentage points higher at 6,0 per cent in 2015, with inflation expected to average 5,9 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is expected breach the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2014, and to reach a peak of 6,6 per cent in the final quarter of the year, before declining to 6,0 per cent in the second quarter of 2015. Core inflation, which averaged 5,2 per cent in 2013, is expected to average 5,8 per cent in 2014, compared with 5,6 per cent in the previous forecast, while the forecast for 2015 has increased from 5,3 per cent to 5,9 per cent. The deterioration in this measure of underlying inflation continues to be driven primarily by the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate. Inflation expectations appear to have remained relatively anchored at the upper end of the target range. According to the survey conducted in the fourth quarter   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 3 4 of 2013 by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University, average inflation expectations of respondents measured 6,1 per cent for both 2014 and 2015 and have remained more or less unchanged since 2011. There is, however, some divergence between the average expectations of respondents, which range between 5,6 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2014, and 5,5 per cent and 6,5 per cent in 2015. Financial analysts have the lowest forecasts, which are also reflected in the latest Reuters survey that indicates expectations of 5,6 per cent and 5,5 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively. While the economic growth outlook for a number of emerging market economies has deteriorated somewhat in recent months, the prospects in the advanced economies have improved, particularly in the US and the UK. However, the recovery remains uneven and not without risks. In the US, growth is being driven by a recovery in the housing market, robust private sector demand, and a dissipation of the negative impulse from fiscal consolidation. In its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, the IMF forecasts growth of 2,8 per cent in 2014 for the US, compared with 1,9 per cent in 2013. The outlook for the Eurozone remains fragile and uneven, particularly in the Southern periphery where the risk of deflation, strong fiscal consolidation and weak banking sectors are constraining the recovery. Eurozone growth in 2014 is expected to remain subdued at around 1,0 per cent.   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 4 5 The Japanese economy has maintained its positive growth but there are still doubts about its sustainability in the absence of continued fiscal stimulus. The outlook for the Chinese economy is increasingly uncertain, given the challenge of containing the excessive increase in credit extension without adversely impacting on growth. Although a growth rate of around 7,5 per cent is still generally expected, the latest PMI, which suggests a contraction of industrial production, indicates some downside risk to this outlook. This uncertainty has contributed to increased risk aversion and volatility in financial markets of emerging economies in recent weeks, and is also likely to impact negatively on commodity prices. Significant currency depreciation and weaker growth prospects are also evident in a number of other large emerging economies, particularly Brazil, Russia and Turkey, while the outlook for the Indian economy appears to have improved somewhat. Global inflation remains benign despite abundant liquidity. However, spillover effects from increasingly divergent monetary policies are creating a difficult and volatile environment for emerging markets. There is still some uncertainty regarding the pace of tapering by the Fed in the coming months, and although market expectations are that the US policy rate is unlikely to increase before at least mid-2015, long term bond yields have increased to around 2,8 per cent from around 1,6 per cent in May 2013. A further sustained improvement in UK growth and employment trends has brought forward the prospect of monetary tightening   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 5 6 by the Bank of England. However, monetary policy is expected to remain highly accommodative in Japan and the Eurozone where the risk of deflation persists. The expectation of tapering by the Fed since May 2013 resulted in significant outflows from emerging economies domestic bond and equity markets, putting pressure on exchange rates and long term bond yields, particularly in those countries with sizeable current account deficits. Some countries, including Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and India, responded by tightening monetary policy, either in reaction to inflationary pressures or in an attempt to stem the depreciation. Since May 2013, cumulative interest rate increases have amounted to 300 basis points in Brazil and 75 basis points in India. The most recent instance has been Turkey which raised its overnight interest rate (MFR) by 425 basis points to 12 per cent. The impact of these developments on the rand exchange rate has resulted in a marked increase in the upside risk to the inflation forecast, despite the relatively muted pass-through to date. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand has depreciated by about 7,4 per cent against the US dollar, by 9,0 per cent against the euro and by 8,0 per cent on a trade weighted basis. Year to date the rand/dollar depreciation has been about 3,5 per cent. In the final two months of 2013, total net sales by non-residents of South African domestic government bonds and equities amounted to R21,0 bn and R19,4bn respectively. These flows effectively reversed the inflows that occurred during the   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 6 7 earlier part of the year, with net purchases of bond and equities for 2013 by non- residents amounting to R1,3 bn, compared with R85,2 bn for 2012. Year-to-date net sales of equities and bonds have totaled R19,3 bn, of which R15,6 bn were bonds. While the recent rand weakness is part of a general emerging market phenomenon, it has been reinforced by idiosyncratic factors including declining terms of trade, on-going labour disputes, and the higher-than-expected current account deficit in the third quarter. Although to date the current account has been slow to react to the depreciation of the rand, the trade surplus of R0,8 bn recorded in November may signify a possible narrowing of the current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, given the volatility of the monthly trade data, it is too early to assess whether or not this is the beginning of a sustainable trend. The extent to which the strikes in the mining sector and resulting decline in exports are likely to impede the current account adjustment further will depend on the duration of the strikes and the extent to which lost output can be compensated for by running down inventories. The economic growth outlook remains subdued amid continued low business confidence. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 is estimated to have recovered somewhat from the low base of 0,7 per cent in the third quarter, and annual   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 7 8 growth in 2013 is estimated to have been around 1,9 per cent. Although an improved outcome is forecast for 2014, growth is still expected to remain below estimated potential output of between 3,0 and 3,5 per cent. The BankÍs forecasts for growth in 2014 and 2015 have been revised to 2,8 per cent and 3,3 per cent respectively, down from 3,0 per cent and 3,4 per cent in the previous forecast round. The BankÍs composite leading business cycle indicator continues to trend sideways, and was marginally negative in November. The mining sector is expected to remain under pressure in the face of work stoppages in the major platinum mines, with the risk of these disruptions spreading to the gold mines. Mining output recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the September lows, and the sector is expected to have made a positive contribution to fourth quarter growth. The manufacturing sector is also expected to have exhibited stronger growth in the final quarter, following the strike-induced contraction in the third quarter. However, the sector has yet to exhibit a meaningful response to the weaker exchange rate, and the Kagiso PMI declined to just below 50 index points in December, for the first time since April 2013. The construction sector presents a mixed picture. The FNB/BER building confidence index remained unchanged at 48 index points in the fourth quarter of 2013, the highest level in 5 years. However, the upward trend in the real value of building plans passed observed in the earlier part of 2013 has leveled off, and   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 8 9 there was a notable decline in November by 12,5 per cent on a month-to-month basis, and a 14,5 per cent decline on a year-on-year basis. The outlook for civil construction, by contrast, appears to be more favourable. These restrained developments in the real sector have contributed to the slow pace of employment creation in the economy, and continued job losses in the private sector remain a concern. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) survey of Statistics South Africa, formal sector employment increased by 13,400 in the year to the third quarter of 2013, or by 0,2 per cent. In the third quarter of 2013, employment losses were most pronounced in mining and construction. Growth in consumption expenditure by households moderated from 2,8 per cent in the second quarter to 2,3 per cent in the third quarter, and is expected to remain relatively constrained by disappointing employment growth and a modest rise in credit extension. Slow growth was particularly evident in the consumption of non-durable goods and services. Real expenditure on durable goods remained strong, with growth of 9,3 per cent. Nevertheless, domestic new vehicles sales appear to be under pressure, having contracted by 3,3 per cent on a quarter-to- quarter basis in the final quarter of 2013. Although retail trade sales increased by 1,2 per cent on a month-to-month basis in November 2013, they increased only marginally, by 0,1 per cent, when the three months to November are compared to the previous three months. Consumer confidence, as reflected in the FNB/BER   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 9 10 consumer confidence index, remained at a low level of -7, a marginal improvement from the previous quarter. Growth in credit extension by the banking system to the private sector continued to lose momentum. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector moderated to 7,4 per cent in November, with credit extension to households measuring 5,9 per cent, compared with 10,4 per cent at the same time in 2012. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households, mainly unsecured lending, measured 8,1 per cent in November, the lowest rate of growth since April 2009, while annualised growth over three months showed a contraction of 0,8 per cent. Although there has been an increase in commercial mortgage credit extension, growth in outstanding residential mortgages remains subdued at 1,3 per cent. Instalment sale credit and leasing finance has continued to be relatively brisk, but could moderate if motor vehicle demand continues to decline. Household debt as a percentage of household disposable income declined slightly from 75,8 per cent in the second quarter to 75,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2013. Wage settlement rates, as measured by Andrew Levy Employment Publications, measured 7,9 per cent during 2013. However, according to QES data, growth in nominal remuneration per worker declined from 8,8 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 2013, to 6,6 per cent in the year to the third quarter. For the economy as a whole, despite a small decline in labour productivity growth, unit   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 10 11 labour cost growth declined over the year from 6,9 per cent in the second quarter to 4,9 per cent in the third quarter. However there are important sectoral differences. For instance, unit labour cost growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated from 5,6 per cent to 6,9 per cent during the same period, while nominal remuneration per worker in the mining sector increased by 9,0 per cent. Food prices have been the main contributor to the downside surprises in inflation in the past two months, with prices increasing by 3,5 per cent in December. Global food prices generally declined during the year amid improved wheat and maize harvests. The rand exchange rate, coupled with disappointing domestic harvests due to drought in some areas, has impacted adversely on the domestic maize and wheat prices in recent weeks, with the spot prices of maize increasing by about 12 per cent during January, following increases of around 20 per cent between August and December 2013. These pressures have not as yet been observed in the producer price index where cereal and other crop prices declined by one per cent over the year in November. Persistent drought conditions in a number of regions have resulted in the culling of cattle, leading to extremely low meat price inflation since September (0,1 per cent in December). However, these favourable food price outcomes are not expected to persist as higher spot grain prices work through to consumer prices. Although the exchange rate pass-through has generally been relatively muted to date, the impact on the petrol price has been almost immediate. International oil   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 11 12 prices have been fairly stable, with Brent crude oil trading in a range of between US dollar 106 and US dollar 109 during January. In December and January the domestic petrol price was increased by a cumulative 55 cent per litre, and a further significant increase, in excess of 30 cents per litre, can be expected in February, primarily as a result of the weaker exchange rate. Sustained upside pressure from petrol prices on inflation can therefore be anticipated should the rand continue to depreciate. The MPC carefully considered the economic challenges facing South Africa and the appropriate policy response. On the one hand, inflation forecasts indicate the possibility of being out of the target range for an extended period, largely due to the impact of the depreciating currency. The risks to the inflation forecast are seen to be significantly on the upside. Large adjustments to the exchange rate will inevitably impact on inflation, even in conditions of relatively low pass-through such as we have been experiencing. On the other hand, the growth outlook remains of concern. Credit extension is low and declining, few jobs on a net basis are being created, and gross fixed capital formation, particularly from the private sector, is significantly below what is required. Capital outflows and a current account deficit exacerbate the difficulties that lie ahead. Exchange rate pressures are expected to intensify as markets adjust to the new pattern of global capital flows. Although monetary policy in the advanced   MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 12 13 economies remains accommodative, the process of normalisation has begun, and the spillovers have implications for our own monetary policy. The primary responsibility of the Bank is to keep inflation under control and ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. The depreciation experienced so far could improve our international competitiveness, provided that it is not eroded through higher wage and other input prices. In the light of these circumstances and taking account of policy trade-offs, the MPC has decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 5,5 per cent per annum as of 30 January 2014. The MPC is of the view that, notwithstanding this increase in the repo rate, monetary policy remains accommodative. Further moves in the repo rate will be highly data dependent. We will continue to monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act as required in keeping with our mandate. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR"
SARB,3,27/03/2014,"South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the global economic environment remains challenging, notwithstanding some improvement in sentiment. Key factors affecting the environment include the possibility of an earlier-than-expected increase in the US policy rate in 2015, further evidence of a slowdown in China, and geo-political tensions arising from the situation in Ukraine. The domestic economic outlook remains subdued amid continued strikes in the platinum sector and uncertainty regarding a stable and sufficient electricity supply in the coming months. While the most recent inflation forecasts suggest marginal improvements in the medium term, upside risks to the inflation outlook persist despite the recent appreciation of the rand, which remains vulnerable to shifts in 1 global risk sentiment and adverse domestic developments. Together with downside risks to growth, this continues to pose a dilemma for monetary policy. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,8 per cent and 5,9 per cent in January and February 2014 respectively, up from 5,4 per cent in December. This marked upward trend was in line with the BankÍs forecasts. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation reversed its previous downward trend, measuring 4,3 per cent and 5,4 per cent in the past two months, compared with a recent low of 3,5 per cent in December. The contribution of this category to the overall CPI inflation increase was 0,8 percentage points in February compared with 0,5 in December. The petrol price, which was the other main contributor to the higher CPI inflation in February, increased at a year-on-year rate of 14,0 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, was unchanged at 5,3 per cent, the sixth consecutive month at this level. This was despite upward pressures from exchange rate sensitive categories such as clothing and footwear, and motor vehicle inflation, which were offset to some extent by a lower rate of increase in medical insurance costs. Administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,9 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 7,7 per cent in February, compared with 7,0 per cent in January. The BankÍs forecast of headline inflation is unchanged for 2014, and is expected to average 6,3 per cent, with the peak of 6,6 per cent still expected in the fourth 2 quarter. The forecast average inflation for 2015 declined from 6,0 per cent previously, to 5,8 per cent, with inflation expected to average 5,6 per cent in the final quarter of that year, compared with 5,9 per cent previously. This improvement is mainly the result of the lagged effect of the repo rate increase. Inflation is still expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2014, and to return to within the target range in the second quarter of 2015, when it is expected to measure 5,9 per cent. The outlook for core inflation has improved, and is expected to average 5,6 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 5,8 per cent and 5,9 per cent for these two years respectively. Notwithstanding this improvement, the upward pressures continue to be seen to be coming from the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation. The MPC still assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be skewed to the upside, as extended periods of overshooting of the exchange rate remain a possibility in the current uncertain global environment. There is also a risk that the current low level of pass-through may not persist. Inflation expectations as measured by the survey conducted by the BER in the first quarter of 2014 remained unchanged at an average of 6,1 per cent for both 2014 and 2015, with inflation of 5,9 per cent expected in 2016. Although the 2014 expectations of analysts increased to 6,1 per cent from 5,6 per cent in the previous survey, expectations of business people declined to 6,2 per cent from 3 6,4 per cent, with trade union expectations unchanged at 6,1 per cent. Analysts expect inflation to moderate during the next two years to within the target range, whilst business and labour respondents expect inflation to remain steady at just over 6 per cent, indicating that expectations continue to be relatively well anchored, albeit at the upper end of the target band. The Reuters survey of economic analysts conducted in March shows that inflation expectations of economists are more or less unchanged since the previous survey, and also remain, on average, anchored at the upper end of the band. The expectation is that inflation will breach the upper end of the target range in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, at an average rate of 6,1 per cent, before returning to within the target range. The global economic recovery continues to be uneven, with a first quarter slowdown in growth in the advanced economies compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, due in part to severe weather conditions, particularly in the US. Nevertheless, the underlying US growth prospects remain relatively favourable despite a slower pace of employment growth, amid positive investment and consumption indicators. The UK economy continues to show signs of sustained improvement, with declining inflation and unemployment rates as well as a buoyant housing market. The Eurozone growth prospects remain weak, although there are signs of a modest recovery, and the unemployment rate appears to 4 have peaked. Japanese economic growth in the fourth quarter was lower than expected, and there are indications that the recovery could be losing momentum. The global outlook, however, is overshadowed by unfolding developments in the Ukraine and Russia regarding Crimea, although to date contagion effects have been limited to those countries with direct trade and financial links with the region. The other downside risk factor relates to a deteriorating outlook in a number of the larger emerging market economies, including Brazil, Russia and China. Recent short-term data from China indicate that economic growth could decline below the governmentÍs target of 7,5 per cent, at a time of increased risks in the banking sector. The slowdown in China is expected to maintain downward pressure on global commodity prices, particularly industrial commodities, while there are upside risks to some commodities, particularly oil and grains, from the tensions in Crimea. Global inflation pressures remain benign, particularly in the advanced economies. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the US has continued its steady path of tapering, although the financial markets now believe that the first interest rate increases may occur earlier in 2015 than previously expected. Over the same period, monetary policy has been tightened in New Zealand, Brazil and Russia, and loosened in Israel, Thailand, Chile and Hungary. 5 The exchange rate of the rand has been relatively volatile since the previous meeting of the MPC, having fluctuated in a wide range between R11,39 and R10,60 against the US dollar. There has been an appreciating trend over this period, in line with an improving risk sentiment towards emerging markets. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by about 2,4 per cent against the US dollar, and by 2,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. While the risk to the inflation outlook from the exchange rate may have moderated somewhat since the previous meeting, these risks are still assessed to be on the upside. The MPC is of the view that the exchange rate will continue to be highly sensitive to both domestic and global developments, remaining prone to further bouts of volatility and protracted periods of overshooting. The current account of the balance of payments narrowed significantly from 6,4 per cent of GDP (revised down from 6,8 per cent previously) in the third quarter of 2013, to 5,1 per cent of GDP in the following quarter, with a deficit for the year of 5,8 per cent. The contraction of the trade account was a result of both a 3,6 per cent decline in the value of merchandise imports and a 0,9 per cent increase in export earnings. Although we expect the current account to respond to the depreciated exchange rate, this adjustment is likely to be gradual and some widening of the trade deficit is expected in the first quarter of 2014. Constraining factors include the protracted nature of the strike in the platinum sector, and the relatively inelastic import demand, particularly with respect to imported capital 6 equipment. Promisingly, net exports made positive contributions to GDP growth in the final two quarters of 2013. Tapering by the US Fed and the expectation of US interest rate normalisation continued to impact on the pattern of global capital flows and financial market volatility. The domestic yield curve flattened since the previous MPC meeting, as the short end increased in response to monetary tightening, while the long end of the curve shifted downwards. In contrast to emerging markets in general, South Africa experienced net inflows into the equity markets in February and March, totalling R11,6 billion, following net sales of R25,1 billion between November 2013 and January 2014. Non-residents remained net sellers of bonds but at a slower pace: net sales of bonds amounted to R46,0 billion over the same three month period, but moderated to R1,2 billion in February, and net purchases of R2,1 billion in March to date. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued. Despite a rebound in the fourth quarter of 2013, when an annualised growth rate of 3,8 per cent was recorded, economic growth is expected to remain below potential of between 3,0 per cent and 3,5 per cent in 2014, with a consequent widening output gap. The BankÍs forecast for economic growth has declined marginally to 2,6 per cent in 2014, compared with 2,8 per cent previously, while the forecast for 2015 has been revised down from 3,3 per cent to 3,1 per cent. The risks to this forecast are seen to be on the downside, given the protracted strike in the platinum sector and 7 electricity supply constraints. This deterioration comes amid continued low levels of business confidence, with the RMB/BER business confidence index declining to 41 index points in the first quarter of 2014, the fourth consecutive month at a level below the neutral 50 index points. The sideways movement of the composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank also points to a restrained outlook. The growth outcome in the fourth quarter of 2013 was led by strong growth in the manufacturing sector in particular, following the strike-induced contraction in the previous quarter. In January, a 2,5 per cent year-on-year rate of growth in manufacturing output was recorded. According to the BER manufacturing survey, business confidence in the sector remains low despite increasing to 41 index points in the first quarter, from 36 previously. There are, however, some positive signs in the sector, with the Kagiso PMI increasing to 51,7 index points in February, and the BERÍs indicators for manufacturing export sales and orders improving further in the first quarter of 2014, to their highest level in 10 years. Despite a strong performance in the fourth quarter, the outlook for the mining sector remains bleak: mining output contracted at a month-on-month rate of 1,1 per cent in January, and the on-going strike in the platinum sector is likely to impact adversely on mining output and exports. 8 Growth in real gross fixed capital formation accelerated to 4,7 per cent in 2013, compared with 4,4 per cent in the previous year. During the past year, real capital outlays by the private sector increased by 5,5 per cent, while public corporations and general government investment increased by 3,1 per cent and 3,5 per cent respectively. Consistent with moderate economic growth, employment growth has remained weak. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) of Statistics South Africa, employment levels in the formal non-agricultural sector increased marginally at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013, or by 5,100 employment opportunities. In the year to the fourth quarter of 2013, the increase was 0,5 per cent or 40,900 jobs, with the public sector contributing 39,000 of these jobs. Overall, private sector employment declined during the fourth quarter, with losses most pronounced in the gold mining, construction and electricity sectors. The weakening trend in the growth in household consumption expenditure continued into the final quarter of 2013, with growth of 2,0 per cent recorded, and its contribution to GDP growth declining from 2,3 percentage points in 2012 to 1,7 percentage points in 2013. Growth for the year averaged 2,6 per cent, while consumption expenditure by general government averaged 2,4 per cent. Household spending on durable goods remained firm, but grew at a slower pace of 6,9 per cent, and is likely to moderate further as vehicle sales come under 9 increasing pressure. Total domestic new vehicle sales declined in February by 2,6 per cent on a month-to-month basis and by 3,1 per cent year-on-year. Although real retail trade sales exceeded market expectations in January, following a month-to-month increase of 0,8 per cent, and a 6,8 per cent increase year-on-year, the outlook for consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained by slow employment growth, high debt levels of consumers, slow rates of growth in credit extension and the higher interest rate environment. Growth in government consumption expenditure is expected to be contained. According to the recent budget, the expenditure cap has been maintained, and a consolidated budget deficit of 4,0 per cent of GDP is estimated for 2014/15, in line with that of the past fiscal year. A faster pace of fiscal consolidation is indicated, with the deficit to GDP ratio expected to decline to 2,8 per cent in 2016/17. Bank credit extension to the private sector has maintained its weak underlying trend, particularly with respect to credit extended to households, reinforcing expected pressures on household consumption expenditure. By contrast, credit extension to the corporate sector was relatively robust, with growth rates of around 10 per cent. Although twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector increased from 6,4 per cent in December to 7,6 per cent in January, credit extension to households increased by 5,5 per cent and 5,6 per cent in these two months respectively. This probably reflects both supply and 10 demand side considerations. Mortgage lending remained weak, with twelve- month growth of 2,1 per cent in January, amid moderate house price growth. Twelve-month growth in general loans, mainly unsecured lending, to households continued its downward trend, measuring 5,0 per cent in January, the lowest rate of growth since February 2005. Instalment sale credit and leasing finance has remained buoyant but growing at a more moderate pace, in line with declining vehicle sales. The trend in wage settlements has remained relatively unchanged. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements measured 7,9 per cent in 2013, compared with 7,6 per cent in 2012. Data from Stats SA show that the growth in nominal remuneration per worker increased from 6,7 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2013, to 7,0 per cent in the fourth quarter. Once the slight increase in productivity growth is accounted for, this translates into a unit labour cost increase of 5,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. While this appears to be relatively contained, there are wide variations across sectors, and the outcome of wage negotiations during the year in an unsettled labour relations environment will be an important determinant of inflation pressures. As anticipated, the favourable trend of food prices in the consumer price index has reversed, and pressures are expected on headline inflation from this source, despite the moderation of prices at the global level. Having reached a recent low 11 of 3,5 per cent in December 2013, consumer food price inflation increased to 4,3 per cent and 5,6 per cent in the subsequent two months. Final manufactured producer food price inflation accelerated to 7,6 per cent in February and further pressures are evident in the agricultural producer price inflation for cereals and other crops which accelerated from -8,2 per cent in August 2013 to 27,6 per cent in February 2014. This contributed to the 7,4 per cent increase in bread and cereals prices at the consumer price level in February. The wheat and maize prices reflect exchange rate pressures and domestic drought conditions. Although futures prices indicate some possible moderation in coming months following the recent rains, near-term pressures remain. International oil prices have been relatively unaffected by the Crimean crisis, and the price of Brent crude oil fluctuated between a relatively narrow range of US dollar 106 and US dollar 111 per barrel since the previous meeting. The exchange rate has been the main driver of the rand petrol price, which increased by a cumulative 75 cent per litre in February and March. The recent appreciation of the rand has resulted in a current over-recovery in the petrol price, and this is expected to offset in part the 20 cent per litre fuel levy increase, due to be implemented in April. The Monetary Policy Committee is acutely aware of the policy dilemma of rising inflation pressures in a subdued economic growth environment. Despite a 12 marginal improvement in the medium term inflation forecast, the trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The main upside risk to the forecast continues to come from the exchange rate, which, despite the recent relative stability, remains vulnerable to global rebalancing. The expected normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies is unlikely to be linear or smooth, and the timing and pace is uncertain. The rand is also vulnerable to domestic idiosyncratic factors, including protracted work stoppages, electricity supply constraints, and the slow adjustment of the current account deficit. Pass-through from the exchange rate to prices has been relatively muted to date but there is some evidence that it is accelerating. However, the forecast already incorporates a higher pass-through than has been experienced up to now. At the same time, the domestic economic outlook remains fragile, with the risks assessed to be on the downside. Demand pressures remain benign as consumption expenditure continues to slow amid weakening credit extension to households and high levels of household indebtedness. The upward trend in the core inflation forecast is assessed to reflect exchange rate pressures rather than underlying demand pressures. 13 Given the lags with which monetary policy operates, the MPC will continue to focus on the medium term inflation trajectory. The committee is aware that too slow a pace of tightening could undermine inflation expectations and may require more aggressive tightening in the future. Consistent with our mandate, a fine balance is required to ensure that inflation is contained while minimising the cost to output. The real policy rate is currently below what can be considered normal in the long run and is likely to increase over the medium term. The pace of tightening will depend on a number of factors including projected inflation, inflation expectations, the state of the economy and global developments. At this meeting the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum. We wish to reiterate that even though we are in a tightening cycle, there will not necessarily be a change in the stance at every meeting, and that the increments may not always be of the same magnitude. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR"
SARB,5,22/05/2014,"South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, inflation has breached the upper end of the target band and is expected to remain outside the target for some time. This development was in line with the BankÍs inflation forecast, which is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The exchange rate has appreciated somewhat since its lows in January in response to a more benign global monetary policy environment, moderating some of the near-term upside risks to inflation. Nevertheless, risks to the inflation outlook remain skewed to the upside. Despite a more favourable global growth environment, the domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated markedly. There is still no end in sight to the protracted strike in the platinum sector, and the economic and social costs are escalating and are potentially devastating. Both the mining and manufacturing 1 sectors appear to have contracted in the first quarter, with electricity supply constraints adding to the weak outlook. Against this backdrop, monetary policy faces an increasingly challenging scenario. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,0 per cent and 6,1 per cent in March and April 2014 respectively, up from 5,9 per cent in February. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation accelerated significantly, measuring 7,0 per cent and 7,8 per cent in the past two months, compared with a recent low of 3,5 per cent in December. The contribution of this category to headline inflation was 1,2 percentage points in April compared with 0,8 percentage points in February. The categories of food, housing utilities and transport together accounted for 3,7 percentage points of the inflation outcome in April. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,5 per cent in March and April after six consecutive months at 5,3 per cent. Administered price inflation excluding petrol continued its gradual decline, measuring 6,5 per cent in April, from 6,7 per cent in March. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 8,2 per cent in March, compared with 7,7 per cent in February, driven mainly by food prices, and is indicative of further upside pressures on CPI inflation in the near term. The BankÍs forecast of headline inflation changed marginally since the previous meeting. Inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,3 2 per cent previously, with the peak of 6,5 per cent (previously 6,6 per cent) expected in the fourth quarter. The forecast average inflation for 2015 remained unchanged at 5,8 per cent. The forecast horizon has been extended and inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent in 2016, and 5,4 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is still expected to remain outside the target band from the second quarter of 2014 until the second quarter of 2015. The outlook for core inflation is also largely unchanged. This measure is expected to average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, compared with the previous forecast of 5,6 per cent for both years, moderating to 5,5 per cent in 2016. The upward pressure is assessed to be a response to the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation rather than evidence of strong domestic demand pressures. The MPC still sees the risks to the inflation forecast to be skewed to the upside, and remains concerned that the current low level of pass-through may not persist. The Reuters survey of inflation expectations of economic analysts conducted in May is more or less unchanged since the previous survey. Inflation is expected to average 6,3 per cent in the second quarter, and 6,2 per cent in the final two quarters of this year, before returning to within the target at an average of 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. Annual inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, and 5,6 per cent and 5,4 per cent in the subsequent two years respectively, somewhat lower than the BankÍs forecast. 3 The global economic outlook remains mixed. Growth in the US stalled in the first quarter as a consequence of the severe weather conditions, while retail sales in April were below expectations. Despite downside risk to growth from the housing market, the recovery is expected to remain on track, although at a lower rate than that forecast earlier in the year. While the Fed expects growth of between 2,8 and 3,0 per cent for 2014, the market consensus is closer to 2,5 per cent. The UK economic recovery also appears to be resilient, despite some slack in the economy. By contrast, the Eurozone continues to lag, following a lower-than- expected annualised growth rate of around 0,8 per cent in the first quarter. The annualised growth rate of 5,9 per cent recorded by the Japanese economy in the first quarter of this year is not expected to be sustained as higher consumption taxes take effect, and consensus forecasts are for annual growth of around 1,5 per cent. The Chinese economy grew at an annualised rate of 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 amid weakening trends in industrial production and retail sales. Although an annual growth rate of between 7,0 - 7,5 per cent is still generally expected, there are concerns that the loss of momentum in the property market and declining credit growth could pose downside risks to growth. The shift in global growth dynamics toward the advanced economies has been reinforced with a number of emerging markets facing a more challenging outlook. Low growth is expected in a number of the larger economies, including Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and Thailand, but some analysts have revised 4 upwards their growth forecasts for India. More positively, growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to average 5,4 per cent, but this is vulnerable to weaker commodity prices in the event of slower growth in China. Global inflation remains benign amid relatively stable food and energy price trends. Financial markets appear to have priced in continued steady tapering of quantitative easing in the US, and recent guidance from the Fed appears to have reduced the degree of volatility and uncertainty in financial markets regarding the pace and timing of monetary policy normalisation. Policy rates look set to increase at a moderate pace in the US and UK during 2015, while the possibility exists of further easing in Japan and the Eurozone, where the risk of deflation persists. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, monetary policy has been tightened in New Zealand, Brazil and Russia in response to inflation pressures or exchange rate concerns, but eased slightly in Hungary. With global financial markets pricing in a slower pace of US policy normalisation, global risk appetite has improved. Apart from sizeable outflows from Russia in the wake of the crisis in the Ukraine, capital flows to emerging markets have resumed, or outflows slowed, resulting in generally appreciating EM currencies and declining long bond yields. This improved sentiment has also impacted on the rand exchange rate, which appreciated by 3,3 per cent against the dollar and by 3,1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting of the 5 MPC. During this period the rand traded in a range of between around R10,70 and R10,29 against the US dollar. Portfolio flows to South Africa have been in line with general global trends. Following cumulative net sales of South African government bonds and equities by non-residents of R71 bn from November 2013 to the end of January 2014, net purchases of bonds and equities since the beginning of February have totaled R8,3 bn and R29,9 bn respectively. Year-to-date net inflows into bonds and equities total R7,6 bn. While recent exchange rate developments have afforded some near-term respite from further inflation risks from the exchange rate, the MPC is mindful of the sensitivity of the rand to both global and domestic factors. The rand is expected to remain vulnerable to changing global perceptions of US monetary policy and associated capital flows. However, while the recent appreciation is more a reflection of changing global risk perceptions rather than a specific re-assessment of South African fundamentals, domestic factors have also impacted on the rand. The exchange rate is likely to remain sensitive to domestic factors, including developments in the current account of the balance of payments and perceptions of its sustainability. In particular, the ongoing strike in the platinum sector is expected to begin to have a significant negative impact on exports, now that inventories are reaching low levels, and a further extension of the strike could impede the required current account adjustment process. 6 The domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated markedly, with the reversal of a number of the tentative positive signs observed at the beginning of the year. The BankÍs forecast for economic growth for 2014 has been revised down from 2,6 per cent at the previous meeting to 2,1 per cent, implying a further widening of the negative output gap. The forecast for 2015 remains unchanged at 3,1 per cent, and growth in 2016 is expected to average 3,4 per cent. However, the risks to these forecasts are increasingly to the downside against the renewed possibility of electricity load-shedding, among other factors. The BankÍs leading indicator of economic activity declined marginally in February, and the sustained sideways movement confirms the subdued outlook, amid weak business confidence. The RMB/BER business confidence index declined by two index points to 41 index points in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter growth outcome was negatively affected by contractions in both the mining and manufacturing sectors. In the first quarter of 2014 the physical volume of mining production declined by 6,8 per cent (not annualised) when compared with the previous quarter. This decline was not confined to the platinum group metals, with production declining in seven of the twelve mining sub-components and expectations are for this negative trend to continue. The physical volume of manufacturing production declined by 1,6 per cent (not annualised) in the first quarter of the year. The contraction was also broad based 7 and the outlook for the sector remains subdued as reflected in the marked decline in the Kagiso PMI to 47,4 index points in April. This follows two consecutive months when the index was above 50 points. The new sales orders component of the PMI remained well below 50 for the second consecutive month. There appears to be continued underutilisation of manufacturing production capacity, particularly with respect to durable goods production. The favourable trend in the real value of building plans passed during the past two years has been maintained in keeping with rising levels of building confidence. The real value of building plans passed increased by 13,6 per cent on the 3-month-to-3-month basis in March 2014, and by 5,9 per cent on a year- on-year basis. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 25,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 in a declining growth environment. This follows a decline in employment in the first quarter of 2014 of 122,000 jobs, although on a seasonally adjusted basis the decrease was 32,000. Consumption expenditure by households is expected to remain constrained in the face of continued weakness in credit extension, rising inflation, high consumer indebtedness, as well as the knock-on effects of the mining strike, where the cumulative loss of wages is estimated to have exceeded R8 billion. Real retail sales grew by 0,6 per cent on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the first 8 quarter of this year, having declined in March by 1,4 per cent on a month-to- month basis. New vehicle sales declined by 0,7 per cent on a 3-month-to-3- month basis in April, and by over 10 per cent on a year-on-year basis while NAAMSA expects new vehicle sales to contract over the year. Although the FNB/BER consumer confidence index improved marginally in the first quarter of 2014, it remained at a low level of -6. Growth in bank credit extension to households continued to moderate, while that to companies has remained relatively robust. The twelve month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,2 per cent in March 2014, driven by a 12,7 per cent increase in credit extension to companies, related in part to the awarding of a new round of renewable energy contracts. By contrast, growth in credit extension to households moderated further to 4,8 per cent, as unsecured lending continued its downward trend. Growth over twelve months in general loans to households, mainly made up of unsecured lending, measured 3,5 per cent in March, the lowest rate of growth since 2005. Growth in mortgage advances to households remained below 3 per cent, in line with the relatively subdued volume growth in the housing market. While growth in instalment sale and leasing finance recorded annual growth of 10,1 per cent in March, it is on a declining trend, particularly with respect to households. These trends in credit extension are expected to remain a constraint on consumption expenditure growth. 9 The trend in wage settlements is more or less unchanged. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was unchanged from the previous year, at 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. However the main wage negotiations are yet to be completed, in particular the re-negotiation of a new multi-year agreement in the Steel and Engineering Bargaining Council. The outcome of this, as well as the impasse in the platinum sector, could have an important bearing on the general trend of wage settlements. Food prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook, although the risk may have moderated somewhat following the sharp reversal in domestic maize prices in recent weeks. Having reached a peak of almost R3,800 per ton in March, maize prices declined in May to around R2,000 per ton, and an 8 per cent decline over the year. This was in response to an upward revision of the domestic maize crop forecast, now expected to be 11 per cent higher than last year, which has resulted in a move from import to export parity prices. This development, if sustained, could help ameliorate the considerable pipeline pressures that have been evident in the producer price index since the beginning of the year. Final manufactured producer food price inflation accelerated to 9,1 per cent in March and further pressures are evident in the agricultural producer price inflation for cereals which measured 26,5 per cent in March, although this is expected to moderate in response to lower spot prices. 10 The international oil price has remained within the range of US dollar 105-US dollar 111 for some time. The domestic price of petrol has benefited from the stronger trend in the exchange rate over the past weeks. In May the price of 95 octane petrol declined by 15 cents per litre, following a 7 cent per litre increase in April, and, should current trends continue, a further reduction can be expected in June. The MPC continues to face the difficult dilemma of dealing with upside risks to inflation and a deteriorating domestic economic growth outlook. Although the breach of the upper end of the inflation target band was in line with the BankÍs forecast, the risks to the forecast remain on the upside. The policy dilemma is increased by the fact that inflation is seen to be driven primarily by supply side factors, while demand conditions in the economy remain subdued. Although the immediate pressures from the exchange rate are lower than was the case earlier in the year, the exchange rate remains a significant source of upside risk to the forecast. The respite from the stronger exchange rate could be temporary and respond quickly to changes in both domestic and external conditions. Although the pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation is still relatively low, there are indications of some acceleration. In addition, food prices are expected to add further upside impetus to inflation in the near term, but this risk may have moderated to some extent given the sharp decline in the maize prices and low global food inflation. 11 As indicated earlier, the BankÍs economic growth forecast for 2014 has been revised down significantly to 2,1 per cent, and the first quarter growth outcome is anticipated to be the lowest quarterly growth rate since the recession in 2009. Although growth in the second quarter is expected to improve somewhat, the risks to the 2014 growth forecast are strongly on the downside, with developments in the mining sector an ongoing cause for concern. The demand side of the economy is also weakening: household consumption expenditure growth continues to moderate amid slower credit extension to households, high levels of consumer debt levels and moderate job growth. However, the weak state of the economy cannot be resolved through monetary policy actions alone. The committee continues to hold the view that we are in a rising interest rate cycle, and interest rates will have to be normalised in due course. We embarked on this process with our first move in January 2014. At this stage the pace and timing of normalisation in the advanced economies appears to have been pushed out further and may be more moderate than previously believed. We are also aware that this can change very quickly. Accordingly, the committee decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum at this stage. Future actions will be data dependent and determined by developments in the inflation outlook and inflation expectations. Inflation is currently at uncomfortable 12 levels and a marked deterioration in the outlook may require action that we will not hesitate to take. The MPC reiterates that a rising interest rate cycle does not mean that rates will be raised at each meeting, or by the same amount each time. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR"
SARB,7,17/07/2014,"South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the economic growth outlook has deteriorated against the backdrop of protracted strike action in the mining and manufacturing sectors. The economy contracted in the first quarter of 2014, and the growth outlook for the rest of the year remains subdued amid low business confidence. Compounding the MPCÍs policy dilemma, inflation has breached the upper end of the target range, driven primarily by the exchange rate depreciation and rising food prices, while a possible wage-price spiral resulting from recent wage settlements and wage demands considerably in excess of inflation and productivity growth have added to the upside risk to the inflation outlook. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,6 per cent in May, up from 6,0 per cent and 6,1 2 per cent in March and April 2014 respectively. The main driver of this marked acceleration was food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation which measured 8,8 per cent in May compared with 7,0 per cent and 7,8 per cent in the previous two months. This category contributed 1,3 percentage points to the headline CPI outcome, compared with a recent low of 0,5 percentage points in December 2013. The categories of food, housing utilities and transport together accounted for 4,2 percentage points of the inflation outcome in May, compared with 3,7 percentage points in the previous month. The transport index increased at an annual rate of 8,9 per cent, from 6,8 per cent in April, despite a 15c per litre decline in the petrol price in May. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, remained unchanged at 5,5 per cent for the third consecutive month. Administered price inflation excluding petrol was unchanged from the previous month at 6,5 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods moderated slightly from 8,8 per cent in April to 8,7 per cent in May, driven in part by lower agricultural product inflation. The marginal improvement in the BankÍs forecast of headline inflation at the previous meeting has been more or less reversed, as recent food price developments surprised on the upside. Inflation is now expected to average 6,3 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,2 per cent previously, with the quarterly peak of 6,6 per cent (previously 6,5 per cent) still expected in the fourth quarter, following a slight moderation in the third quarter. The forecast average inflation for 2015 increased to 5,9 per cent from 5,8 per cent, while the forecast for 2016 3 increased marginally to 5,6 per cent, and to 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is still expected to return to within the target band during the second quarter of 2015, provided that there are no further shocks to the system, particularly from possible higher tariff increases being granted to Eskom by Nersa from 2015. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged. This measure is expected to average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, moderating to 5,5 per cent in 2016, with the moderate upward pressure coming from the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation rather than evidence of strong domestic demand pressures. As before, the MPC sees the risks to the headline inflation forecast to be skewed to the upside. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University have remained anchored at the upper end of the target band. The average inflation expectation of analysts, business people and trade union officials for this year and next year has remained unchanged for six consecutive quarters at 6,1 per cent for both years, declining to 5,9 per cent in 2016. Within these categories, the largest change was by business people for 2016, where expectations increased from 6,2 per cent in the previous survey to 6,4 per cent. However, their expectation for 2015 moderated slightly. Inflation expectations of households for 2014 declined from 6,7 per cent in the first quarter to 6,3 per cent in the second quarter. 4 The Reuters survey of inflation expectations of economic analysts conducted in May is more or less unchanged since the previous survey, with a slight upward shift. The outcome of the survey shows a divergence of views among analysts as to whether inflation will peak in the second or fourth quarter of 2014. On average, the expectation is for inflation to peak in the second quarter, at an average of 6,4 per cent, and to return to within the target range in the first quarter of 2015. According to the survey, annual inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, and 5,7 per cent and 5,5 per cent in the subsequent two years respectively. The global economy continues to exhibit mixed signals regarding the economic growth outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, consensus forecasts for growth in 2014 have been revised down for the US and the Eurozone, but those for Japan and the UK have been revised upwards. The earlier optimism that the US would grow at around 3 per cent in 2014 has been moderated following the 2,9 per cent annualised contraction in the first quarter, partly a result of severe weather conditions and a decline in expenditure on health care. Most analysts now expect US growth to be closer to 2 per cent. This weaker growth is despite larger-than-expected improvements in the unemployment rate. The outlook for the Eurozone has also deteriorated, following weak industrial output in Germany in May, and slowing growth in France and Italy. Real output in Japan is expected to contract in the second quarter following the surge in expenditure in the first quarter in advance of the increase of consumption taxes. The UK recovery, 5 however, appears to be sustained with growth of around 3 per cent expected in 2014. The outlook for emerging markets remains relatively subdued, but some emerging Asian economies have benefited from stronger US growth. The Chinese economy is expected to grow just under 7,5 per cent in 2014, although concerns about the shadow banking system remain. Subdued growth is expected in a number of emerging markets including Brazil, Russia, Thailand and Argentina. Global financial market developments remain dominated by expectations of changes in monetary policy in the advanced economies, amid concerns that the current low interest rate and low volatility environment may encourage excessive risk taking and asset price bubbles. By contrast to a number of emerging market economies, inflation remains benign in the advanced economies, although the risk of deflation in the Eurozone persists. The UK is expected to be the first advanced economy to raise interest rates, but at a moderate pace, while the US is generally not expected to begin the process of normalisation before the third quarter of 2015. However, the tapering of bond purchases by the Fed is expected to continue at a steady pace. This process is fully discounted in the markets, and is expected to be completed later this year. 6 By contrast, the ECB has recently announced a range of new monetary policy measures aimed at stimulating the economy through encouraging bank lending and preventing deflation, while Japanese monetary policy is expected to remain highly stimulatory for some time. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, a number of countries have reduced their policy rates, including the Eurozone, Sweden, Mexico, Hungary and Turkey, while the tightening cycle continued in New Zealand. The exchange rate of the rand continues to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Having appreciated to a level of R10,29 against the US dollar soon after the previous MPC meeting, the rand exchange rate followed a depreciating trend, reaching a new trading range of between R10,60 and R10,80 since the beginning of June. Since the previous meeting the rand has depreciated by 2,6 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The appreciation of the rand in May was in response to more benign global factors as market participants absorbed the forward guidance provided by the central banks in the advanced economies. This contributed to lower risk aversion and renewed flows to emerging markets in general. Since the previous meeting, non-resident net purchases of bonds and equities amounted to R7,2 billion, and R44,2 billion since the beginning of February. Despite these inflows, since early June the rand has largely decoupled from its emerging market peers, and depreciated relative to most currencies, as it reacted to deteriorating domestic fundamentals. These included the negative GDP growth 7 rate, the adverse reports from the ratings agencies, and the protracted nature of the platinum and metal workers strikes. The impact of the platinum sector strikes on exports began to be felt in April and May, and it is estimated that during these two months the value of platinum group metals (PGM) exports was around R20 billion lower than during the first quarter. This is likely to put pressure on the current account of the balance of payments in the second quarter, following a narrowing of the deficit in the first quarter to 4,5 per cent of GDP. South AfricaÍs growth outlook has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC, compounded by continued labour disruptions. Following a contraction of 0,6 per cent in the first quarter, the outlook for the second quarter is expected to be positive, but subdued, particularly in the light of weak mining and manufacturing data in May. The BankÍs latest forecast, which assumes a speedy resolution of the metal workersÍ strike, sees growth in 2014 at 1,7 per cent, compared with 2,1 per cent previously and 2,8 per cent at the beginning of the year. Growth forecasts for the coming two calendar years have been reduced to 2,9 per cent and 3,2 per cent, from 3,1 per cent and 3,4 per cent respectively. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index remained low and unchanged at 41 index points in the second quarter of 2014, with a sharp decline particularly evident among manufacturers. The BankÍs leading indicator of economic activity declined moderately, reflecting subdued growth expectations. 8 The weak business confidence is mirrored in the 2,6 per cent growth in gross fixed capital formation in the first quarter of 2014. Growth in fixed investment by the private sector, which accounts for about two thirds of gross fixed capital formation, weakened further, from 2,4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 1,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The mining sector contracted by an annualised 24,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2014, and although mainly driven by the strike-induced decline in PGM output, the contraction was fairly broad-based across the sector. Despite a higher-than- expected performance in April, the data for May show that the outlook for the second quarter is also bleak. In May, the physical volume of mining output declined by (a non-annualised) 3,1 per cent on a month-to-month basis, and by 5,6 per cent on a three-month-to-three month basis, with PGM output declining by 34,1 per cent. While the strike is over and miners are returning to work, PGM production is not expected to normalise for some time, and possible shaft closures could reduce the longer term potential of the sector. The manufacturing sector performance in the first two months of the second quarter has also been disappointing, following the 4,4 per cent contraction in the first quarter. In May, manufacturing output declined by 3,7 per cent on a year-on- year basis, and by 2,0 per cent on a three-month-on-three-month basis. The sector was negatively impacted by electricity supply constraints and the platinum sector strike, while the current strike by metal workers is likely to undermine the 9 outlook for the third quarter. The Kagiso PMI registered a slight improvement in June, measuring 46,6 index points, but has remained below the neutral 50 index point level for three consecutive months. Trends in employment growth are indicative of the weak private sector investment. Although formal non-agricultural employment increased for the third consecutive quarter in the first quarter of 2014, all the gains were in the public sector. While overall employment increased by 42,000 jobs in the year to the end of March, 49,000 jobs were created in the public sector while the private sector shed jobs, particularly in the mining sector where almost 29,000 jobs were lost. Final consumption expenditure by households remains the main driver of GDP growth, but with a declining contribution of 1,2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2014. Growth in household consumption expenditure, which measured 2,6 per cent in 2013, declined to 1,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014, with a marked moderation in the growth of expenditure on durable goods and a contraction in spending on non-durable goods. Real retail sales growth contracted by 0,8 per cent on a three-month-to-three-month basis in May, and increased at a month-to-month rate of 0,8 per cent. Domestic motor vehicle sales declined by 2,3 per cent on a year-on-year basis, but increased by 4,7 per cent on a month-to-month basis in June. Despite these weak trends, consumer confidence surprised on the upside in the second quarter, with the FNB/BER 10 consumer confidence index increasing from -6 to 4 index points, although respondents do not deem the present time as appropriate to buy durable goods. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,2 per cent in May 2014, but the divergent trends in bank credit extended to households and the corporate sector have continued. Growth in credit extended to the corporate sector has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year, measuring 13,3 per cent in May, due in part to renewable energy contracts. By contrast, growth in credit extended to the private sector has continued to trend downwards, to measure 4,3 per cent in May. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households, mainly unsecured lending, declined to 2,8 per cent in May, its lowest growth since February 2005. Mortgage credit extension remained within the 2 to 3 per cent range observed since January 2013, and instalment sale credit and leasing finance also continued to moderate, from growth rates of around 13 per cent in the second half of 2013 to 8,6 per cent in May. These credit extension trends to households reflect a combination of weakening household consumption expenditure, and stricter bank lending criteria for unsecured loans in particular. Household debt to disposable income remains elevated, but declined marginally to 74,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The trend in wage settlements pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook, and these pressures are likely to intensify in the current difficult labour relations environment. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average 11 wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements increased from 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 to 8,1 per cent in the second quarter. However, increases over four quarters in nominal unit labour costs in the formal non- agricultural sector, declined from 5,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 4,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The MPC is concerned that recent wage settlements in the mining sector and current demands in the metals sector could set a precedent for wage demands more generally. Unless accompanied by higher productivity, such settlements could generate a wage price spiral, and are also likely to have a negative impact on employment trends. While the focus has generally been on wage demands, there is an imperative for attention to also be paid to excessive salaries and bonuses of management and executives. Food prices have been one of the main drivers of inflation since the beginning of the year and have generally surprised on the upside in recent months. There are, however, some tentative indications that we may be near the peak: in May, manufactured food producer price inflation moderated for the first time since October 2013, and measured 8,9 per cent, down from 9,5 per cent in April. Agricultural producer price inflation declined from a recent peak of 13,3 per cent in March, to 6,7 per cent in May reflecting in part the sharp decline in maize prices to export parity price levels. Prices of cereals and other crops declined by 0,8 per cent in May, having reached a recent peak of 27,6 per cent in February. Global food price pressures are also benign, with the year-on-year inflation rates as reflected in the FAO food price index being negative for 12 consecutive 12 months. Apart from weather-related risks, the overall trend in food prices will remain highly sensitive to exchange rate developments. Despite recent geopolitical risks, particularly in the Ukraine and Iraq, international oil prices have remained relatively stable. Apart from a brief spike to a level of around US dollar 115 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has generally traded in a range of US dollar 105 and US dollar 110 per barrel, and is currently at around US dollar 105 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices have therefore been driven primarily by exchange rate changes. Following the appreciation of the rand in April, the petrol price was reduced by a total of 37 cents per litre in May and June, but this was largely reversed in July when the price increased by 31 cents per litre. Should current trends persist, a further small increase in the petrol price can be expected in August. The MPC remains concerned about weak growth, widening output gap and the negative employment outlook. The strike in the platinum sector contributed to the downward revision of the growth forecast, and the latest forecast has not factored in the possibility of a protracted work stoppage by the metal workers, which would potentially have much wider ramifications because of the direct linkages to other sectors of the economy. This weak growth outlook, however, is not something that monetary policy can ameliorate. The MPC is also increasingly concerned about the inflation outlook, and the further upside risks to the forecast. Although the exchange rate remains a key 13 factor in this regard, the possibility of a wage-price spiral should wage settlements well in excess of inflation and productivity growth become an economy-wide norm has increased. Although the inflation trajectory has not deteriorated markedly since the previous meeting, upside risks have increased, and it is expected to remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range when it does eventually return to within the target. The upside risk factors make this trajectory highly vulnerable to any significant changes in inflation pressures. Although inflation expectations have remained relatively anchored, should inflation persist outside the target band, these expectations risk becoming dislodged. The MPC is, however, cognisant of the fact that the inflation pressures do not reflect excess demand conditions in the economy. Household consumption expenditure remains weak, and credit extension to households is contracting in real terms. However, we do have to be mindful of second-round effects of supply side shocks. The MPC faces an increasingly difficult dilemma of rising inflation and slowing growth. The core mandate of the Bank remains price stability, but at the same time, in achieving this mandate, we have to be mindful of the impact of our actions on economic growth and tread a fine line between acting effectively to address the inflation objective, while not undermining growth unduly. 14 The MPC has decided to continue on its gradual normalisation path and raise the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5,75 per cent per annum, effective from Friday 18 July. Given the expected inflation trajectory, the real repurchase rate remains slightly negative and well below its longer term neutral level. The monetary policy stance remains supportive of the domestic economy, and, as before, any future moves will be gradual and highly data dependent. We would like to reiterate that monetary policy should not be seen as the growth engine of the economy. The sources of the below par growth performance are largely outside the realms of monetary policy. In the short term, an improvement in the interaction and relationships between management and labour is essential to foster a climate of trust and confidence, and get South Africa back to work. Given that the key headwinds preventing a return to trend growth are structural, there is an urgent need to implement necessary structural reforms, as envisaged in the National Development Plan, in order to achieve higher and more inclusive growth. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR"
SARB,9,18/09/2014,"South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the domestic inflation forecast has improved slightly, but the inflation trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. At the same time the domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated further, with declining growth in both consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation, as confidence remains low. The combination of stubborn inflation and a sluggish growth outlook continues to pose a difficult dilemma for monetary policy. The global environment has been characterised by increased financial market volatility, following heightened speculation relating to the timing and extent of US monetary policy normalisation. This impacted on emerging market currencies in general, and on the rand in particular. This was further illustrated after yesterdayÍs FOMC meeting, which reaffirmed the gradual pace of US monetary policy normalisation, and its data dependent nature. However, despite increased political instability and significant risks in a number of regions, the international oil price has declined along with continued weakness in global food prices, contributing to a more benign global backdrop for the domestic inflation outlook. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas surprised on the upside at 6,4 per cent in August, having measured 6,6 per cent and 6,3 per cent in June and July 2014 respectively. The higher turnout was mainly due to higher-than-expected food prices, which had been anticipated to continue their recent downward trend. Downward pressure was exerted by petrol prices which increased by 5,8 per cent, down from 8,3 per cent in July. The categories of food, housing utilities and transport together accounted for 3,8 percentage points of the inflation outcome in August, unchanged from the previous month. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, increased to 5,8 per cent, from 5,7 per cent in July, driven mainly by the impact of the weaker exchange rate on some goods categories. Administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,5 per cent, up from the 6,4 per cent in July. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods, which reached a recent high of 8,8 per cent in April, measured 8,1 per cent and 8,0 per cent in June and July respectively, driven in part by lower agricultural product inflation. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 2    The BankÍs forecast of headline inflation is slightly more favourable than that presented at the previous meeting, mainly a result of lower expected food and petrol price pressures. Whereas for some time inflation had been forecast to peak at an average of 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, the peak now appears to have occurred in the second quarter, at an average of 6,5 per cent. Inflation is now expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,3 per cent previously, and 5,7 per cent in 2015, (5,9 per cent previously), and to return to within the target range in the first quarter of 2015 instead of the second quarter as previously forecast. The inflation forecast for 2016 increased to 5,8 per cent from 5,6 per cent, mainly as a result of the revised electricity price assumption following the review of Eskom tariffs by Nersa. The revised assumption makes provision for electricity price increases of 11,6 per cent from July 2015 and again from July 2016. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged at an average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, reaching a peak of 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, and moderating to 5,5 per cent in 2016. As before, the MPC sees the risks to the headline inflation forecast to be skewed to the upside, with possible renewed pressure coming from the exchange rate. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2014, have again remained more or less unchanged, and anchored at around the upper end of the target range. Inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014 and 6,1 per cent and 6,0 per cent in 2015 and 2016 respectively. As usual, there is a MPC Statement September 18th, 2014     Page 3 fairly wide dispersion of expectations between the different categories of respondents. While business people expect inflation to average 6,4 per cent in 2015 and 2016, analystsÍ expectations average 5,7 per cent and 5,4 per cent. Expectations of trade unionists are for 6,2 per cent in both years, and all categories of respondents expect inflation in the current year to average 6,2 per cent. Household inflation expectations for 2014 remained unchanged at 6,3 per cent. The global growth recovery remains asynchronous amid sustained improvements in the US and UK, and deteriorating prospects in the Eurozone and Japan. Although growth in the US is not expected to exceed the 2,2 per cent achieved in 2013, this is mainly a result of the contraction during the first quarter of this year. Real output growth of 4,2 per cent was recorded in the second quarter of 2014, and consensus forecasts are for growth rates of around 3 per cent in the next two quarters. Similar growth rates are expected in 2015. At the same time the unemployment rate has been declining at a faster pace than previously anticipated. While the growth outlook for the UK remains positive, possible downside risks could emerge should Scotland vote for independence from the United Kingdom. Growth in the Eurozone has remained weak, with the German economy also under pressure following a contraction in the second quarter. Sanctions on Russia are expected to be an additional constraint affecting the EurozoneÍs growth outlook. Although the Japanese economy appears to be recovering from the VAT-induced slump in the second quarter, the recovery looks fragile. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 4    While emerging Asia appears to be benefiting most from the US recovery, emerging markets generally are facing increasing headwinds. Signals coming out of China continue to be mixed, amid a sharp slowdown in industrial production in August. Latin American economies also face a challenging outlook, particularly in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, which is currently experiencing a technical recession. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain relatively strong, although commodity producers may be adversely affected by lower commodity prices and possible spillover effects from the Ebola outbreak. There is a continued absence of significant upside global inflation risks, despite pressures experienced in some emerging markets. The various indicators of US inflation remain well contained below the 2 per cent level, while the fear of deflation in the Eurozone persists. Declining international oil and food prices, along with a number of other commodity prices, are expected to reinforce the current benign global inflation environment. The divergent growth outlooks in the advanced economies are likely to be the main drivers of monetary policy developments. The UK is expected to tighten monetary policy early next year. The stronger performance of the US labour market has led to heightened speculation that normalisation may begin earlier than previously anticipated. These expectations resulted in an appreciation of the US dollar against most currencies, as well as rising long-term US Treasury yields ahead of yesterdayÍs FOMC meeting. At yesterdayÍs press conference the FOMC Chair reaffirmed the view that policy normalisation will occur gradually, but is contingent on no surprises to employment growth or inflation in either direction. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014     Page 5 The data dependent nature of the forward guidance means that changes in the outlook for inflation, unemployment and growth are likely to lead to bouts of global financial market uncertainty in advance of FOMC meetings in the coming months. At the same time, however, the ECB has loosened monetary policy and has indicated its willingness to embark on some form of quantitative easing should this be necessary. Monetary policy is also expected to remain accommodative for some time in Japan. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, policy rates have been reduced in the Eurozone, Israel, South Korea, Chile and Hungary, and increased in Russia and New Zealand. Following a few weeks of relative stability, the rand exchange rate weakened in the past few days in response to US dollar strength, as well as the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments to 6,2 per cent of GDP. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand initially traded in a range of R10,50 and R10,75 against the US dollar, but has weakened since early September reaching a low of R11,07. On a trade-weighted basis, however, the rand depreciated by 0,4 per cent, having appreciated against the euro and the British pound. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to changes in sentiment regarding possible changes in US policy which will affect the appetite for emerging market assets generally, as well as to possible impacts from geopolitical risks and domestic factors. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 6    Since the previous MPC, non-residents have been net sellers of bonds to the value of R29,3 billion, but this has been offset in part by net purchases of equities to the value of R16,2 billion over the same period. Year to date there have been net outflows of bonds and equities to the value of R6,3 billion. These trends indicate that financing of the current account through portfolio inflows is likely to become increasingly challenging. The current account deficit in the second quarter of 2014 was wider than generally expected by the markets, following the 4,5 per cent of GDP recorded in the first quarter. This widening was a result of increased dividend outflows, lower dividend inflows following a large once-off inflow during the first quarter, and weak export growth, impacted to some extent by the platinum strike. Export growth in the third quarter is expected to remain constrained by the slow return to full capacity production by the platinum mines and the strike in the steel and engineering sector in July, which had significant spillover effects on the manufacturing sector in general. The current account is anticipated to narrow gradually over time. The domestic economic growth outlook remains weak following growth rates of -0,6 per cent and 0,6 per cent in the first and second quarters of the year respectively. These growth rates are well below potential output growth and indicative of a widening output gap. Partly as result of this outcome, as well as the expected impact of the metal workers strike in July, the BankÍs forecast for GDP growth for 2014 has been revised down further to 1,5 per cent, from 1,7 per cent previously, with the risks still assessed to be on the downside. The forecasts MPC Statement September 18th, 2014     Page 7 for both 2015 and 2016 have been revised down by 0,1 percentage points, to 2,8 per cent and 3,1 per cent respectively. The BankÍs leading indicator of economic activity continues to trend sideways, consistent with a subdued growth outlook. Business confidence, as reflected in the RMB/BER business confidence index, remains negative despite a five index point increase to 46 in the third quarter. Adding to prevailing concerns are indications from Eskom that electricity supply constraints may be more severe and endure for longer than previously expected. The near-term outlook for mining remains subdued, with platinum production not expected to return to full capacity before the end of the year. In July, mining production recorded a broad-based year-on-year decline of 7,7 per cent, but a 0,9 per cent increase on a month-to-month basis. Manufacturing output declined significantly in July, recording year-on-year and month-to-month contractions of 7,9 per cent and 5,4 per cent respectively, largely due to the impact of the four- week strike in the steel and engineering sub-sector. Capacity utilisation in the sector declined from 82,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 to 80,6 per cent in the second quarter. More positively, the Kagiso PMI reflected some improvement in sentiment in August, with the index rising 3,1 index points to 49, marginally below the neutral level, while the construction sector has recorded growth rates of 5 per cent in the first two quarters of the year. Growth prospects have been constrained by the weakening trend in gross fixed capital formation which grew at an annualised rate of 0,5 per cent in the second quarter. Real fixed capital expenditure by both the public corporations and the private sector contracted during the quarter. Of particular concern is the MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 8    continued downward trend over the past three quarters in private sector investment, despite higher capital outlays in the manufacturing sector. This has been reflected in the continued slow pace of employment creation in the private sector and the rise in the unemployment rate to 25,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2014. Consumption expenditure by households also continued its moderating trend which began in the first quarter of 2012, amid declining real disposable income growth. Annualised growth of 1,5 per cent was recorded in the second quarter of 2014. The slowdown was particularly marked in the durable and semi-durable goods categories, probably impacted by the prolonged strikes in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Retail trade sales contracted by 0,9 per cent in June on a month-to-month basis, but increased by 1,2 per cent in July, higher than generally expected. Wholesale trade sales contracted by 5,2 per cent month-to- month in July, and by 4,6 per cent year-on-year. Domestic vehicle sales have also slowed. Given the above, somewhat surprisingly the FNB/BER consumer confidence index increased from -6 to +4 in the second quarter. Trends in credit extension to households are consistent with the weak growth in household consumption expenditure, showing a further divergence between credit extension to households and to the corporate sector. Growth in total loans and advances over the year measured 9,7 per cent in July, with lending to the corporate sector increasing by 17 per cent, and to households by 4,1 per cent. The latter reflects continued sluggish growth in mortgage credit extension and MPC Statement September 18th, 2014     Page 9 tighter credit criteria for unsecured lending in particular. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, reached a low of 0,2 per cent in July, while growth over three months exhibited an annualised contraction of 2,5 per cent. This decline is across all income groups, but more pronounced at the lower levels. A positive development is that household debt to disposable income moderated from 74,4 per cent in the first quarter to 73,5 per cent in the second quarter. Growth in corporate sector borrowing during the first half of the year was dominated by the agricultural sector, electricity supply (renewable energy projects) as well as wholesale and retail trade sectors. The cost of bank funding appears to have increased recently as a result of changed regulatory requirements relating to the implementation of Basel III, the impact of the bail-in of certain African Bank Limited creditors and the consequent rating action by MoodyÍs Investor Service, all of which could result in tighter funding conditions. No new wage and unit labour cost data have been released since the previous meeting of the MPC, although settlements in the steel and engineering sector and the clothing sector have been well above current and expected inflation rates. The MPC remains concerned about the apparent delinking of wage demands and some wage settlements from underlying inflation and productivity growth trends, as well as the possible impact of forthcoming wage negotiations, including in the public sector. These concerns relate to settlements at all levels, MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 10    including executive pay. Excessive wage settlements could have adverse impacts on employment, inflation, the general competitiveness of the economy and the profitability and viability of small businesses in particular. Notwithstanding the 9,5 per cent increase in July, food price inflation is expected to slow over the coming months. Pipeline pressures from agricultural prices continue to moderate following sharply lower maize prices since March, while manufactured food price inflation declined to 8,5 per cent in July compared with 9,5 per cent in April. International food prices, as reflected in the FAO international food price index, declined for the fifth consecutive month in August in response to positive maize and wheat supply conditions. These developments are expected to impact favourably on domestic consumer prices, although base effects are likely to interrupt the declining year-on-year trend in the final months of the year. International oil prices declined in recent weeks, having traded in a range of between US dollar 105-US dollar 114 per barrel for the year to the end of July. Since August, the price has fallen below this range and is currently trading at around US dollar 98 per barrel. This is despite rising tensions and instability in the Middle East and conflict in the Ukraine, events that in the past would likely have resulted in an oil price spike. As a result of this lower price, the domestic petrol price was reduced by 67 cents per litre in September, having been unchanged in August. At this stage there is an average over-recovery on the petrol price due to the lower MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 11    international price, but the favourable impact is being partially offset by continued rand weakness. Despite the slight near-term improvement in the inflation outlook and the relatively stable inflation expectations, the MPC is concerned that the forecast remains uncomfortably close the upper end of the target band. Given the upside risks to the forecast, the proximity to the upper end of the band makes the inflation outcomes highly vulnerable to changes in inflationary pressures. A key upside risk is the exchange rate, which is vulnerable to the slow pace of adjustment to the current account deficit, as well as to the uncertainty surrounding the future path of monetary policy in the advanced economies. At this stage it is difficult to assess the extent to which normalisation of US monetary policy is already priced in to the rate. The MPC remains concerned about the risks of a wage-price spiral, should settlements well in excess of inflation and productivity growth become the economy-wide norm. Such developments could also undermine South AfricaÍs international competitiveness and delay the current account adjustment. The deterioration in the longer term inflation trajectory relative to the previous forecast is a result of the revised tariff increases granted to Eskom by Nersa. The view of the Committee is that such relative price adjustments should not be reacted to automatically. However, while the focus of monetary policy should be MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 12    on the second round effects of these increases, this is complicated given the multi-year nature of the adjustment. While inflation is the primary focus of the Committee, the MPC is also mindful of the anaemic state of the domestic economy, rising unemployment and the downside risk to its growth forecast. Domestic expenditure has deteriorated further, particularly private sector fixed capital formation, and, together with continued moderation in household consumption expenditure, is indicative of the lack of demand pressures in the economy. The MPC is still of the view that interest rates will have to normalise over time. However, given the slightly improved inflation outlook notwithstanding the upside risks, the stable inflation expectations and the downside risks to the weak growth outlook, the MPC has decided that the repurchase rate will remain unchanged at 5,75 per cent per annum. Despite the 75 basis point increase so far this year, monetary policy remains accommodative, and will continue to be supportive of the domestic economy subject to achieving its primary inflation targeting objective. Future decisions will, as always, be highly data dependent. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR"
SARB,11,20/11/2014,"South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the sharp decline in international oil prices has contributed to a more benign global inflation environment. This development may also ameliorate the deteriorating growth outlook in some regions by providing a boost to consumption expenditure. Lower oil prices have also had a favourable impact on domestic headline inflation, with the medium-term forecast improving relative to the previous forecast. However, the underlying inflation pressures, as reflected in core inflation, persist. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, but after two quarters dominated by the fall-out from extended strikes, some recovery is expected, but demand remains subdued. The coming quarters are expected to see an improved performance in the mining and manufacturing sectors, but the outlook is inhibited by domestic structural constraints, as well as by a weak global economy and the continued declining trend in non-oil commodity prices. Growth next year is expected to remain weak. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,9 per cent in both September and October, having measured 6,4 per cent in August. Downward pressure on inflation in October came from continued moderation in food and petrol prices. Food price inflation continued its downward trend, measuring 8,0 per cent in October, down from 8,7 per cent previously, while petrol prices increased by 2,4 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, moderated to 5,6 per cent in September from 5,8 per cent in August, but measured 5,7 in October, reflecting primarily continued exchange rate pass-through to some goods categories. Administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,4 per cent in October, down from 6,5 per cent in September. Headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods, which reached a recent high of 8,8 per cent in April, measured 7,2 per cent and 6,9 per cent in August and September respectively, driven in part by lower food and fuel price inflation. The BankÍs forecast of headline inflation has improved since the previous meeting of the MPC, mainly due to the impact of declining international oil prices. Having reached a peak of 6,5 per cent in the second quarter of this year, inflation is now expected to average 5,9 per cent in the final quarter of 2014, and average 6,1 per cent for the year, compared with 6,2 per cent previously. The downward trend is expected to continue into next year, with inflation forecast to reach a low of 5,1 per cent in the second quarter, and to average 5,3 per cent for the year, compared with 2 5,7 per cent previously. The forecast for 2016 has been revised down from 5,8 per cent to 5,5 per cent, and is expected to measure 5,4 per cent in the final quarter of the year. The forecast for core inflation, by contrast, is more or less unchanged at an average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, reaching a peak of 5,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 (previously 5,8 per cent), and moderating to 5,3 per cent in 2016, down from 5,5 per cent previously. The MPC assesses the risk to the headline inflation forecast to be broadly balanced. The results of the fourth quarter inflation expectations survey of the BER will only be released in December. Market-based surveys, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey, however, show that the median CPI inflation expectation of analysts has remained unchanged over the past two months at 5,7 per cent and 5,5 per cent for 2015 and 2016 respectively. Break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation linked bonds) declined since the previous meeting and reflect expectations within the target range for 5 year maturities, and marginally above the upper limit of the inflation target range at 10 year maturities. The US and the UK remain the main drivers of global growth although more broadly, global growth may get some impetus from lower oil and food prices, which should provide some boost to consumers. US economic growth was better than expected in the third quarter, with the first advanced estimate of 3,5 per cent, and the unemployment rate declining to 5,8 per cent, the lowest level since June 2008. The UK recorded growth of 2,8 per cent in the third quarter, while the unemployment rate 3 was unchanged at 6,0 per cent. The Japanese economy contracted for a second consecutive quarter during the third quarter, and has prompted a reconsideration of a further VAT increase next year. The response to the further additional monetary stimulus announced recently remains uncertain amid a tighter fiscal policy stance. The Eurozone outlook also remains bleak, including in the core countries such as France and Germany, although lower food and oil prices, coupled with further monetary easing may have a positive impact. The outlook for emerging markets is mixed, with emerging Asian economies expected to benefit most from the positive spillovers from the US recovery. This is expected to offset in part the adverse impact of the slowdown in China, where growth is expected to be lower than in the past few years, as the economy rebalances away from investment towards consumption. This moderation is expected to continue to impact negatively on commodity prices. The Indian economy is showing signs of sustained recovery, while the other Brics partners, Russia and Brazil, face significant growth headwinds. Oil exporters generally are expected to face challenges from international oil price weakness. Global inflation is expected to moderate in the face of benign food price inflation and falling international oil and other commodity prices. While this is welcome in the higher inflation regions, particularly emerging markets, it does aggravate deflationary risks in some of the advanced economies, particularly in the Eurozone and Japan. Monetary policy stances are expected to remain ultra-loose in these two regions, with a significant stimulus package announced recently in Japan and the ECB is anticipated to conduct further asset purchases. The US Fed has ended its programme of quantitative easing, but at this stage it is not contracting its balance 4 sheet and proceeds from maturing assets are being reinvested. Although the general expectation is that the US Fed will begin raising interest rates in mid-2015, there are also some expectations that the more benign inflation outlook could delay this. Forward guidance from both the Bank of England and the US Fed is that any adjustment is likely to be gradual, and policy rates may be lower than their estimated long run normal rates for some time despite the improved growth outlooks. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, policy rates have increased in Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, but reduced in Sweden, South Korea, Chile and Poland. The exchange rate of the rand has been relatively volatile since the previous meeting, in response to external and domestic factors including changing expectations of the timing of the first US interest rate increase as well as the downgrade of South AfricaÍs credit rating by MoodyÍs Investor Service. Although the rand initially weakened sharply against the US dollar, at one stage reaching a level of R11,36 against the US dollar, this move has since largely been reversed. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated marginally against the US dollar, but appreciated by 2,1 per cent and 3,5 per cent against the euro and sterling respectively, and by 1,8 per cent on a trade weighted basis. The rand is expected to remain susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment regarding changes in monetary policy stances in the advanced economies, and the continued uncertainty regarding the extent to which US normalisation is already priced in to the exchange rate. The asynchronous nature of advanced economy monetary policies is expected to complicate the outlook and outcomes. However, the rand is likely to remain more sensitive to changes in financial conditions in the US than in Japan and the Eurozone. The persistently slow adjustment of the current account deficit also 5 makes the rand vulnerable to swings in sentiment that raise concerns about the financing of this deficit. Although the lower oil prices should reduce the oil import bill, its positive impact on the deficit may be limited by further declines in other commodity prices. The volatility in portfolio capital flows is indicative of fickle global investor sentiment. Net bond sales by non-residents amounted to R12,6 bn in September and R2,1 bn in October and a further R1,5 bn to date in November. In the equities market, having been marginal net sellers in September, non-residents were net buyers to the value of R5,7 bn in October but net sellers of R6,3 bn to date. The domestic growth outlook remains subdued. Although an improved growth outcome is expected in the third quarter, following the 0,6 per cent growth in the second quarter, this is off a low base following prolonged strikes in the mining and manufacturing sectors. The BankÍs forecast for GDP growth in 2014 has declined marginally from 1,5 per cent to 1,4 per cent, and forecasts for 2015 and 2016 have been revised down from 2,8 per cent and 3,1 per cent to 2,5 per cent and 2,9 per cent respectively. This restrained outlook is consistent with the BankÍs composite leading indicator of economic activity which continues to trend sideways, with a slight upward move recently. The RMB/BER business confidence index improved in the third quarter, but at 46 index points, remains below the neutral level of 50. The mining sector appears to be recovering to some extent from the strike-affected first half of the year, and is expected to contribute positively to third quarter growth, following two consecutive quarters of contraction. The physical volume of mining production increased by 0,7 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, and further increases can be expected in the final quarter, as platinum 6 output is still below pre-strike levels. By contrast, although the physical volume of manufacturing production increased in September, the month-long strike in the steel and engineering industry in July contributed to a quarter-to-quarter contraction of 1,3 per cent in the third quarter. Sentiment indicators suggest that the outlook for the sector remains bleak, with the manufacturing confidence index still at very low levels and capacity utilisation rates back at 2011 levels. More positively, the Kagiso PMI edged above 50 index points in October for the first time since March, driven mainly by the inventory and new sales orders sub-indices. The outlook for the construction sector is more positive, with the real value of building plans passed increasing for the fourth successive month in August. On a three-month-to-three-month basis, an increase of 9,8 per cent was recorded. However, while the various building confidence indices have generally improved, they remain below the neutral level. The weak pace of economic growth is mirrored in the unemployment rate, which, according to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa measured 25,4 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 24,5 per cent a year earlier. Total employment increased at a year-on-year rate of 0,5 per cent in the quarter. At the same time the number of discouraged workers increased sharply, by almost 100,000, and now total 2,5 million. Consumption expenditure by households has remained relatively subdued, but there are signs of a moderate increase in the quarterly growth rate, as the negative effects of the protracted strikes on consumption dissipate. Consumption expenditure could be positively impacted by lower petrol prices. Although retail sales growth declined by 0,8 per cent (non annualised) in September, quarter-to-quarter growth of 0,9 per 7 cent was recorded in the third quarter, and 2,3 per cent year-on-year. Similarly, wholesale trade sales contracted in the third quarter, but increased by 5,9 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Motor vehicle sales have also shown some signs of recovery, although domestic sales are expected to be lower this year than in 2013. Retail sector confidence improved, with the BER reporting retailer confidence above the neutral level for the first time in two and a half years. Consumer confidence, however, declined significantly in the third quarter following an unexpected increase in the second quarter. Trends in bank credit extension to the private sector have remained characterised by declining growth in advances to households, while advances to corporates have been buoyant. Total loans and advances grew at a twelve month rate of 8,8 per cent in September, but excluding mortgages the growth rate was 13,5 per cent, compared with a recent high of 18,6 per cent in December 2012. Credit extension to the household sector grew by 3,7 per cent in September, as unsecured lending remained weak despite a reversal of the negative growth trend in the month, but credit to the corporate sector grew by 15,3 per cent. Twelve-month growth in mortgage advances to households remained at levels below 3 per cent, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance continued its downward trend, with growth of 6,9 per cent. These trends are likely to constrain consumer demand in the coming months. According to the October Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, government remains committed to its policy of fiscal consolidation, in order to prevent an increase in the debt ratio to unsustainable levels. The fiscal deficit is expected to decline from a projected 4,7 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal year to 3,0 per cent in 2017/18. 8 This is expected to be achieved through adherence to a nominal expenditure growth ceiling, and increased tax revenues. The ability to achieve the nominal expenditure targets will be determined to an important degree by the public sector wage settlement. Wage trends remain broadly unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, wage settlement rates averaged 8,0 per cent in the first nine months of the year. Nominal remuneration per worker as well as productivity trends in the formal non-agricultural sector were distorted by the significant increase in temporary employees by the Independent Electoral Commission, which contributed to the decline in the year-on-year increase in remuneration from 6,3 per cent to 3,5 per cent, while productivity declined by 1,6 per cent. The net result was a marginal increase in unit labour costs of 5,2 per cent in the second quarter, from 5,1 per cent previously. Food price inflation remains a major driver of inflation, but is expected to continue to moderate in the coming months. Food price inflation appears to have peaked at 9,5 per cent in August, and has since moderated to 8,0 per cent in October, as lower producer prices of crops and cereals, which declined by 6,3 per cent in September, are beginning to have an impact at the consumer price level. Restocking of herds following the drought last year, however, has kept meat price inflation elevated. Food price pressures also remain benign at the global level, with the Food and Agricultural Organisation international food price index declining for seven consecutive months to its lowest level since August 2010. International oil prices have declined markedly since their recent peak in June of around US dollar 115 per barrel to current levels of below US dollar 80 per barrel. This decline 9 reflects a combination of factors, including increased supply coming from the US and Libya, moderating demand from China in particular, and changes in the internal dynamics within the OPEC cartel. The general expectation in the market is that these lower prices could persist for some time. Although some of the advantage of lower international oil prices has been offset to some extent by a weaker rand exchange rate, domestic petrol prices have declined by a cumulative R1,17 per litre since August, and should current trends continue, a further decline of around 70 cents per litre can be expected in December. The marked decline in international oil prices has had a significant impact on the medium term outlook for headline inflation in the global economy and in South Africa. At this stage it is unclear whether this is a temporary shock, or if it will be sustained or decline further. As with an oil price increase, we would look through the impact effect and focus on the possible second round effects of this decline. The possibility that oil prices are sustained at current levels introduces a degree of downside risk to the inflation forecast. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, and the risks to the forecast are assessed to be moderately on the downside. The MPC does not see significant signs of excess demand pressures that are impacting on the inflation outlook and household consumption expenditure is expected to remain constrained. At the same time, despite its recent relative stability, the exchange rate remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook, vulnerable to changing perceptions of the timing of global monetary policy adjustments, and the slow pace of contraction in the current account deficit. The extent to which policy normalisation is already priced into the exchange rate is also unclear. 10 A further upside risk to the inflation forecast comes from a possible increase in wage settlement rates in excess of inflation and productivity growth in the coming year. In light of this assessment, the MPC sees the overall risk to the headline inflation forecast to be more or less balanced. However, given the elevated level of core inflation, and the fact that headline inflation is expected to increase later in the forecast period as the first round effect of the oil price decline dissipates, the Committee remains vigilant and will continue to monitor developments closely. The Committee remains of the view that interest rates will have to normalise over time. However, given the lower trajectory of headline inflation and the continued weak state of the economy, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,75 per cent per annum at this stage. The timing of future interest rate increases will be dependent on a range of factors, including the evolution of inflation expectations, the speed of normalisation of monetary policy in the US and the state of the domestic economy.
