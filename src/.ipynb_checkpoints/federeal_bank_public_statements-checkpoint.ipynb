inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa<e4><f3><bb>s long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody<e4><f3><bb>s Investors Service (Moody<e4><f3><bb>s) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government<e4><f3><bb>s response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank<e4><f3><bb>s (SARB) measure of core inflation <e4><f3><f1> which excludes food fuel and electricity <e4><f3><f1> amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB<e4><f3><bb>s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody<e4><f3><bb>s continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB<e4><f3><bb>s composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers<e4><f3><bb> Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months<e4><f3><bb> time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong <e4><f3><d6>Black Friday<e4><f3><bb> effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa<e4><f3><bb>s local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction</td></tr>\n",

have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa<e4><f3><bb>s long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody<e4><f3><bb>s Investors Service (Moody<e4><f3><bb>s) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government<e4><f3><bb>s response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank<e4><f3><bb>s (SARB) measure of core inflation <e4><f3><f1> which excludes food fuel and electricity <e4><f3><f1> amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB<e4><f3><bb>s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody<e4><f3><bb>s continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB<e4><f3><bb>s composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers<e4><f3><bb> Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months<e4><f3><bb> time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong <e4><f3><d6>Black Friday<e4><f3><bb> effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa<e4><f3><bb>s local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction | \n",

       "1 In recent weeks some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs Investors Service (Moody\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs (SARB) measure of core inflation \\xe4\\xf3\\xf1 which excludes food fuel and electricity \\xe4\\xf3\\xf1 amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers\\xe4\\xf3\\xbb Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months\\xe4\\xf3\\xbb time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong \\xe4\\xf3\\xd6Black Friday\\xe4\\xf3\\xbb effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa\\xe4\\xf3\\xbbs local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction"
