      "1 In recent weeks some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody Investors Service (Moody) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food fuel and electricity amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months  time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong  Black Friday effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction\n"



                                                                                             </td><td>Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the near-term inflation outlook has deteriorated, but the longer-term outlook is more or less unchanged. The expected inflation profile has been negatively affected by higher international oil prices and a persistence in elevated food price inflation despite improved rainfall in many of the drought-stricken regions. At the same time, the rand has displayed some resilience. While some of the key risks to the rand appear to have subsided for now, they could re-emerge at any stage. Global growth prospects are mixed amid policy uncertainty, primarily in the US and the UK. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, although a modest improvement is expected over the forecast period. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,8 per cent in December, up from 6,6 per cent in November. The December outcome surprised on the upside relative to the Bank<d5>s forecast and the market consensus expectation of 6,5 per cent. The main sources of this surprise included food prices, housing rentals, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels. Food price inflation remained elevated at 12,0 per cent in December, matching the recent high recorded in October 2016. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome has remained unchanged at 1,8 percentage points for the past 3 months. Goods price inflation measured 7,8 per cent in December, up from 7,7 per cent in November, while services price inflation increased from 5,6 per cent to 5,9 per cent. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,9 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 6,9 per cent in November, compared with 6,6 per cent in October. The main contributor to the November outcome was the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 3,9 percentage points. The inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to only return to within the target range during the final quarter of 2017, and to average 6,2 per cent for the year, compared with 5,8 per cent in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2018 is more or less unchanged at an average of 5,5 per cent. The peak of the forecast remains at 6,6 per cent, which was recorded in the final quarter of 2016, and this level is now expected to persist in the first quarter of 2017. This deterioration is mainly due to changed assumptions regarding international oil prices, the domestic fuel prices and the outlook for food prices, which more than offset the more favourable exchange rate assumption.By contrast, the forecast for core inflation is unchanged, averaging 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research during the fourth quarter of 2016 showed average inflation expectations for 2017 declining from 6,0 per cent in the third quarter to 5,8 per cent. The same outcome is expected for 2018, as well as for 5-year inflation expectations. Despite the slight moderation, expectations remain more or less anchored at the upper end of the target range, but with a narrower divergence between the different groups of respondents than is usually the case. The expectations of these groups ranged from 5,6 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2017, and from 5,4 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2018. The outcome may have been distorted by the marked decline of 0,6 percentage points for the trade union respondents. The median annual inflation expectations of market analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey are relatively unchanged at 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent for 2017 and 2018. Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates declined across all maturities since the previous meeting, though remain above the target range. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, despite increased optimism regarding US growth following the US presidential elections. There is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the policies of the new administration, particularly with respect to the size of the promised fiscal stimulus. While some of the initial optimism has since been tempered somewhat, US growth is expected to be relatively strong, but with some downside risks posed by a stronger dollar. Uncertainty also persists regarding the prospects for the UK economy, as the terms of the disengagement from the EU are unlikely to be resolved for some time. The steady but slow growth recovery in the Eurozone is expected to continue, but upcoming elections in a number of countries could pose risks to the outlook, alongside ongoing concerns about the prospects for the Italian economy. The outlook for emerging markets is also unclear, given conflicting developments. Commodity prices, especially industrial commodities, have risen in recent months, but protectionist threats from the US, if carried through, could undermine world trade and have an adverse effect on emerging markets in particular. These countries are also highly dependent on Chinese growth, which is expected to remain above the 6 per cent level. However, given the credit-driven nature of recent Chinese growth, there are fears of an unsustainable credit bubble which could expose financial sector vulnerabilities, and undermine the growth outlook. There are tentative signs of global inflation edging up, as fears of deflation recede amid higher energy and food prices. As expected, the US Fed tightened monetary policy in December, and signalled further increases to come. However, the pace of increase is still expected to be relatively moderate amid a highly uncertain economic policy environment. Both the ECB and the Bank of Japan have maintained their highly accommodative policy stances. This divergence between the advanced economies is likely to persist for some time. The rand has displayed a degree of resilience since the previous meeting of the MPC, having traded in a relatively narrow range of between R14,22 and R13,46 against the US dollar. Since the previous meeting, the rand has appreciated by 5,6 per cent against the US dollar and by 4,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand was positively impacted by the decisions of the ratings agencies not to downgrade the sovereign foreign credit rating to sub-investment grade, although this remains a risk in the coming months. The limited response of the rand exchange rate to the increase in the US policy rate in mid-December suggests that the move had been largely priced in. A gradual pace of tightening is expected in the US, with the rand vulnerable to any upside surprises in this respect. The rand has been positively affected by the improvement in the terms of trade, following the recent modest increase in commodity prices. Although the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow over the forecast period, it remains relatively wide. In line with the recent improved capital flows to emerging economy bond markets, non-residents have been net buyers of South African bonds since the beginning of the year, while equity net sales have continued. This follows persistent net sales of both bonds and equities during the last three months of 2016. The domestic growth outlook remains weak and more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The Bank expects growth to have averaged 0,4 per cent in 2016, although recent monthly data for the fourth quarter suggest that there may be a downside risk to this forecast. The forecast for 2017 has been revised down marginally to 1,1 per cent (from 1,2 per cent), and remains unchanged at 1,6 per cent for 2018. This improved outlook relative to 2016 is consistent with the recent upward trend in the composite leading indicator of the Bank. By contrast, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined again in the fourth quarter, following a recovery in the previous quarter. Much of this decline was driven by the new vehicle sector. The recent monthly data paint a bleak picture for the fourth quarter of 2016. Mining production, which had improved in the second and third quarters, contracted in both October and November. However, improved commodity prices are expected to help the sector in the coming months. The manufacturing sector recorded low but positive growth in November, following a month-to-month decline in October. The Barclays Purchasing Managers<d5> Index (PMI) declined further in December, and recorded its fifth consecutive month below the neutral 50 level. The low level of business confidence is reflected in the continued, but slower, contraction in real gross fixed capital formation. Gross fixed investment has contracted for four consecutive quarters, and has been particularly marked in the private sector. This has contributed to the persistent labour market weakness, with formal non-agricultural employment (excluding temporary election-related employment) remaining unchanged in the year to the third quarter of 2016. The official unemployment rate increased to 27,1 per cent, its highest level since the inception of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey in 2008. Wage growth appears to be responding to the weak labour market environment. Year-on-year nominal wage growth per worker moderated for a fifth consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2016, down to 5,8 per cent. Following a small decline in labour productivity growth, nominal unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sector increased to 5,7 per cent. The slower nominal wage growth per worker is consistent with the lower wage settlement rates reported by Andrew Levy Employment Publications. Household consumption expenditure data paint a mixed picture. Growth in household consumption expenditure accelerated to 2,6 per cent in the third quarter despite a further contraction in durable goods consumption. Real retail trade sales declined in October, but increased markedly in November on a month-to-month basis. By contrast wholesale trade sales contracted in both months. Domestic new vehicle sales remained subdued following further declines in the final quarter of last year. Notwithstanding some improvement, consumers remain under pressure and consumer confidence remains low, as indicated in the sharp contraction in the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index in the fourth quarter. Households remain highly indebted despite a further moderation in the debt ratio, and the subdued housing and equity markets have contributed to an absence of strong wealth effects. Slower wage growth along with stagnant employment growth and expected tax increases in the forthcoming budget are also likely to dampen consumption expenditure. A further constraint to consumption expenditure growth has been the weak credit extension to the private sector, which, at 4,5 per cent in November, was the lowest year-on-year growth since late 2010. While growth in credit extension to the household sector was particularly subdued, that to the corporate sector also moderated in the second half of 2016. The strongest decline was seen in mortgage credit extension for commercial property. Food price inflation is expected to decline following good rainfall in parts of the country. Spot prices for both maize and wheat have declined significantly, and a markedly higher maize crop is expected this year. However, the impact on prices at the consumer level are yet to be felt, with meat prices likely to lag other food price categories as farmers restock their herds. Although the Bank<d5>s inflation forecast assumes that food price inflation has more or less peaked, the pace of moderation is expected to be slower than in the previous forecast. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7,0 per cent during 2017, compared with 6,5 per cent previously. Food price disinflation is expected to be constrained or delayed by higher fuel costs and a rising trend in global food prices. Brent crude oil prices increased by over 20 per cent to almost US 60 per barrel in response to the OPEC-brokered agreement to restrict production. Prices have since moderated to current levels of around US 55 per barrel. The sustainability of this agreement and its longer-term impact on prices is uncertain, given the possibility of offsetting developments. A number of oil producers were exempt from the agreement; there are incentives and scope for cartel members to exceed their quotas; and US shale producers have already increased production in response to higher prices. These factors are likely to constrain oil price increases. While the Bank<d5>s oil price assumption has been revised up, the trajectory is relatively flat. Despite the stronger rand exchange rate, the domestic price of 93 octane petrol increased by 50 cents per litre in January, and a further increase can be expected in February. The MPC has noted the marked deterioration in the inflation forecast since the previous meeting, as well as the extension of the expected breach of the upper level of the target range by a further two quarters. Inflation is now expected to return to within the target range in the final quarter of 2017. While this is a cause for concern, the main drivers of this deterioration are supply side shocks, in particular oil and food prices. The increase in the international oil price is not expected to be a start of a new oil price spiral. Various supply side factors are expected to constrain oil prices going forward in the absence of any major global political risks that would threaten production. While the food price forecast has been adversely affected by higher input costs, a steady decline in food price inflation is still expected. The more favourable rand exchange rate has been an important factor in offsetting some of the negative impacts of these developments. Despite a turbulent second half of 2016, both domestically and globally, the rand has been relatively resilient. Furthermore, the current level of the rand is stronger than that implicit in the forecast, and pass-through to inflation continues to be relatively muted. Nevertheless it remains vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks. As always, the approach of the Committee is to look through the first-round effects of exogenous shocks, but remain focused on the possible emergence of second-round effects which could require a policy response. At this stage, the longer-term trajectory over the relevant policy horizon is unchanged, as is the forecast for core inflation. In particular, the MPC will take note of possible changes in the longer-term inflation expectations, which had shown tentative signs of moderation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside. The domestic growth outlook has remained largely unchanged despite a possible weaker outcome in the fourth quarter of 2016. While some improvement is anticipated over the forecast period, growth is expected to remain below potential. The risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be broadly balanced. Growth prospects remain dependent on uncertain but tentatively improving global conditions, and their impact on commodity prices. Domestically, some improvement in agricultural production can be expected. However, a significant improvement in growth prospects requires the implementation of structural reforms which could contribute to increased business and consumer confidence. In light of these developments and the assessment of the balance of risks, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains focused on the medium- to longer-term inflation outlook, but the deterioration of the shorter-term outlook requires increased vigilance. Furthermore, the MPC remains concerned that the longer-term inflation trajectory continues to be uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The Committee retains the view that we may be near the end of the hiking cycle. However, should second- round effects emerge that undermine the longer-term inflation outlook, there may be a reassessment of this view. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR</td></tr>\n",

Committee (MPC) the inflation outlook has improved. This was mainly due to the further appreciation of the rand exchange rate following the benign market reaction to the US Fed monetary policy tightening, as well as the significant narrowing of the domestic current account deficit. A more positive growth outlook in the advanced economies has also contributed to a more favourable environment for emerging markets generally. However, the recent heightened domestic political uncertainty has reversed some of these exchange rate gains, and the risk of further rand weakening overshadows the inflation outlook. Domestic growth prospects remain constrained, although the low point of the cycle is probably behind us. Demand pressures are expected to remain weak amid low business and consumer confidence. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.3% in February, from 6.6% in January, in line with the market consensus expectation. Food price inflation, which measured 10.0%, moderated for the second consecutive month following its recent peak of 12.0% in December. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.9 percentage points in January to 1.7 percentage points in February. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5.2%, down from 5.5%. This follows a recent peak of 5.9% in December 2016. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5.6% in February compared with 5.9% in January. The category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerated for the sixth consecutive month to 8.4%, following its recent peak of 13.4% in August last year. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved, reversing most of the deterioration seen at the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter previously, and to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. CPI inflation is expected to average 5.9% for the year, compared with 6.2% in the previous forecast, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated from an average of 5.5% to 5.4%. The forecast period has been extended to 2019, with an expected average of 5.5% for the year. This improvement is mainly due to a more appreciated exchange rate assumption. Despite the recent depreciation, the current level of the rand is still consistent with the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. Although the international oil price  assumption remains unchanged, the exchange rate is expected to lead to lower petrol price inflation, and is reflected in a downward revision to the assumption for administered prices. This favourable trend is partially offset by a slower pace of disinflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages, driven by an expected acceleration in poultry prices in particular. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7.4% and 5.2% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.0% and 5.0% previously. The forecast for core inflation is marginally lower than before at an average of 5.4% in 2017, and unchanged at 5.2% in 2018. An average core inflation of 5.3% is expected in 2019. Inflation expectations as measured by the Bureau for Economic Research show a deterioration over the near-term in particular. The average expectation for 2017 has increased from 5.8% to 6.2%, with the largest upward revisions coming from businesses and labour respondents. The average expectation for 2018 increased marginally from 5.8% to 5.9%, while the expected inflation for 2019 is 6.0%. By contrast, average inflation expectations over five years declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.7%. Median inflation expectations of economic analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in March, are more or less unchanged since January. Inflation is expected to average 5.8% in 2017, and 5.5% and 5.4% in the coming two years, roughly in line with the Bank<d5>s forecast. Inflation expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation linked bonds) had declined since the previous meeting, but have since spiked following the recent depreciation of the rand, and remain above the 6.0% level for longer-dated maturities. The global economy shows continued signs of a broad-based improvement. The growth outlook in the US remains favourable with business confidence indices at high levels. However, there is growing uncertainty about the timing and size of the expected fiscal stimulus. Tax reform may take longer than anticipated following the recent failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Growth prospects in Japan and Europe are also more promising, with the PMI reaching a six-year high in the euro area, led by the services sectors in France and Germany. The extent to which the sustainability of this improvement is dependent on the highly accommodative monetary policy stance is still unclear. The outlook for emerging markets is also more positive, in part driven by the recovery in the advanced economies, and stronger demand in China. Firmer commodity prices have also helped, but an oversupply of some commodities could limit these gains. Global inflation provides a mixed picture with the recent decline in international oil prices threatening to reverse the broad-based increases in headline inflation in the advanced economies. Some inflation normalisation is evident in the US and the euro area, but Japan is showing less momentum in price and wage growth. Inflation in the UK is expected to overshoot the target for some time, as the economy adjusts to a weaker currency. Similarly, inflation experiences in a number of emerging economies have reflected divergent currency movements. The US Fed raised its policy rate in March in response to the stronger inflation trend and improved growth outlook. While this action was widely expected, the gradual nature of the expected interest rate cycle implicit in the forward guidance surprised the markets. Policy rates are expected to remain at low levels for some time in most of the advanced economies until more favourable inflation and growth dynamics are more firmly entrenched. For the past few months the rand exchange rate had been relatively resilient, along with a number of other emerging market currencies. While most measures of emerging market risk have narrowed over recent months, those for South Africa have widened again over the past few days. The rand has depreciated significantly in response to increased domestic political uncertainty and the exchange rate has re- emerged as an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by 3.9% against the US dollar, by 4.0% against the euro and by 3.4% on a trade-weighted basis. The prospect of US monetary policy tightening had been seen as a risk to the exchange rate. However, the rand and other peer currencies strengthened in response to the Fed actions in March, indicative of revised market expectations of a more moderate tightening cycle than that priced in. The rand has also been underpinned by favourable terms of trade trends. Furthermore, the improving trend of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments has reduced the perceived vulnerability of the rand to possible capital flow reversals. However, while significant adjustment of the current account has occurred, the deficit is not expected to remain at the level seen in the fourth quarter of last year. The domestic growth outlook remains weak following the negative growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2016 annual GDP growth of 0.3% is likely to have been the low point of the growth cycle, and a mild recovery is expected over the forecast period. The Bank<d5>s forecast for GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points in both 2017 and 2018, to 1.2% and 1.7%, with growth of 2.0% forecast for 2019. While growth is still expected to be below estimated potential output growth of around 1.4% in the near term, the output gap is expected to narrow to some extent in the later part of the forecast period. The more favourable growth outlook is consistent with the Bank<d5>s leading indicator of economic activity which has increased for six consecutive months. The main drivers of growth are expected to be net exports and positive, albeit weak, household consumption expenditure growth. Some impetus is expected to come from fixed capital formation in the outer period of the forecast. At a sectoral level, the agricultural sector is expected to return to positive growth following good rains in a number of regions and improved maize crop estimates. A modest recovery in the manufacturing sector is expected following two consecutive months of the Absa PMI being above the neutral 50 point level, while the mining sector is forecast to respond to more favourable commodity prices. Low growth in gross fixed capital formation remains a downside risk to growth in the short term. In 2016 gross fixed capital formation contracted for the first time since 2010, with the ratio of fixed capital formation to GDP declining from 20.4% in 2015 to 19.6% in 2016. Private sector investment remains particularly weak, having contracted for five successive quarters. This is reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which increased marginally in the first quarter of 2017, but at 40 index points remains well below the neutral level of 50. The BER Manufacturing survey shows a sharp decline in expected capital investment over the next 12 months, with the political climate cited as the main reason.  The constrained growth outlook does not bode well for employment creation in the economy. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, employment increased by 0.3% while the number of unemployed grew by 11.3%. This resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate by 2.0 percentage points to 26.5%. Consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 0.8% in 2016 remains subdued amid low consumer confidence. While growth of 2.2% was recorded in both of the final two quarters of the 2016, negative retail and wholesale trade sales growth in December and January underscore the likely persistence of this weakness. New vehicle sales continued to decline in February, although exports increased significantly. These trends are expected to persist as the impact of a higher tax burden, low employment growth and weak wealth effects take their toll on consumption expenditure. In addition, credit extension by banks to the private sector continues to grow at low rates, particularly to households amid a further decline in the household debt to disposable income ratio. Expenditure will be supported to some extent by positive but moderate real income growth. Fiscal policy as outlined in the recent budget remains committed to a steady pace of deficit reduction over the next three years. Lower tax revenues relative to budget <d0> partly a consequence of slower economic growth <d0> have resulted in a shortfall to be filled by a combination of lower expenditure growth, increased fuel levies and other excise duties, and a number of tax changes. These include limited compensation for fiscal drag and a higher marginal tax bracket for high-income earners. The tax   increases are expected to act as a drag on household consumption expenditure, particularly for middle and upper income earners. International oil prices have declined following increased oil inventories and weak compliance with the OPEC-brokered deal to restrict output, and an increase in shale gas production in the US. Although Brent crude oil prices increased by about 10% in the wake of this agreement, these gains have been largely reversed, with oil prices back in the region of US 50 per barrel for the past three weeks. The impact on the domestic petrol price will be evident in April when a reduction is expected, despite the 39 cent increase in the Road Accident Fund and fuel levies provided for in the February budget. Since the previous MPC meeting the inflation outlook has improved. However, the risk to the inflation forecast has been affected by the reaction of the of the exchange rate to the current elevated levels of political uncertainty. At current levels of around R13.00 against the US dollar, the exchange rate is still moderately stronger than the level implied in the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. However, the rand is likely to react further to unfolding developments until a greater degree of certainty and confidence is restored. The possibility of significant overshooting of the exchange rate in the short run also cannot be ruled out. As always, the MPC will attempt to <d2>look through<d3> short term fluctuations and focus on longer term trends in its policy settings.  The MPC remains concerned about the elevated level of inflation expectations. While the near-term reversal was not unexpected, given the deterioration of the short-term inflation outlook in January, the longer term expectations remain anchored uncomfortably at the upper end of the target range. Not all the inflation risk factors are on the upside. The deterioration in the forecast at the previous meeting was due in part to a higher international oil price assumption. This assumption has not been adjusted to reflect the recent market developments. There is a downside risk to this assumption, given the possibility of these more moderate trends persisting. A further downside risk comes from electricity price increases, which could turn out to be lower than the 8.0% currently in the forecast from mid-2017. The final price determination by the energy regulator is yet to be announced. Overall, the MPC assesses the risk to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside, mainly due to the high degree of exchange rate uncertainty. The MPC sees no evidence of significant demand pressures impacting on inflation. The growth outlook remains disappointing, and the MPC is concerned that increased political uncertainty could impact negatively on private sector investment and household consumption expenditure, and further undermine employment growth. The risks to the growth outlook are therefore assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance and one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9     The MPC is of the view that we may have reached the end of the tightening cycle. However the Committee would like to see a more sustained improvement in the inflation outlook before reducing rates. This assessment may however change if the inflation outlook and the risks to the outlook deteriorate.

                                                                                             </td><td>Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Headline inflation has now returned to within the target range as expected, with outcomes in March and April surprising on the downside. While the inflation outlook has improved over the near term, the longer-term forecast trajectory is unchanged and uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The rand exchange rate and domestic bond yields benefited from increased global capital inflows to emerging markets which largely offset the impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade. With further ratings decisions imminent, risks remain for a further depreciation against the backdrop of continued global and domestic political uncertainty. 1      Domestic economic growth prospects have deteriorated, as the impact of the ratings downgrade is expected to weigh on domestic investment and consumer sentiment over the forecast period. The output gap is estimated to have widened, and consumer demand has weakened. However, the trajectory of the growth forecast is still positive, and the growth rate for this year is expected to exceed that recorded in 2016. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.1% and 5.3% in March and April. Food price inflation was the main contributor to the downside surprise in April when it measured 6.6%. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.5 percentage points in March to 1.1 percentage points. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8%, down from 4.9%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods also surprised on the downside at 4.6% in April compared with 5.2% in March. The further moderation in food prices was also reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the sixth consecutive month to 6.4%. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved over the near term, but is unchanged in the outer quarters. In line with the previous forecast, headline consumer price inflation is expected to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. Inflation is expected to average 5.7% this year compared with 5.9% previously, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated by 0.1 percentage point to 5.3%. The forecast average for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%.  The improvement is driven by downward revisions to international oil price and domestic electricity tariff assumptions. In the latter case, a tariff increase of 4.0% with effect from July 2017 is assumed, down from 8.0%. These revisions have been offset to some extent by a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, and a slower decline in food price inflation. A continued moderation of food prices is expected over the medium term given the favourable agricultural outlook and significant upward revisions to the maize crop estimates. Food price inflation is expected to average 7.7% and 5.4% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.4% and 5.2% previously, and unchanged at 5.5% in 2019. The forecast for core inflation in 2017 is 0.4 percentage points lower at 5.0%, partly due to the lower starting point of 0.2 percentage points following the sizeable downside surprise in March. The forecast for 2018 declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%, and is unchanged at 5.3% in 2019. Market-based inflation expectations are largely unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, with the median forecasts in the latest Reuters Econometer survey similar to those of the Bank. The median expectation for 2017 declined marginally to 5.7%, and is unchanged at 5.5% and 5.4% for the next two years. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates in the bond market have also moderated since the previous meeting. Break-even inflation rates for shorter-dated maturities are below 6% but higher than this level for longer-dated maturities. The global growth outlook continues to show signs of sustained recovery amid rising world trade volumes. Nevertheless, the trend growth rate is expected to be lower than that experienced before the global financial crisis. The current recovery is characterised by downward revisions to potential output growth in numerous countries, and generally low levels of productivity and wage growth. Despite a weak first quarter, US growth is expected to average above 2.0% this year, although further policy uncertainty could undermine investor and consumer confidence. Growth rates in the euro area and Japan are expected to be sustained at around 2016 levels, supported by accommodative monetary policies. The outlook for emerging markets is also generally positive. Concerns about Chinese growth have dissipated somewhat following policy intervention, but high leverage in the financial sector remains a risk. While Russia has emerged from recession, the expected recovery in Brazil may be undermined by current political uncertainty. The outlook for commodity producers may be tempered by recent weaker commodity price trends, particularly those of iron ore and coal. Global inflation remains relatively benign although country experiences differ. Inflation is below target in most of the advanced economies, apart from the UK, and the risk of deflation is low except in Japan. Where high inflation rates are being experienced in a number of emerging markets, these are generally driven by exchange rate shocks rather than underlying global price pressures. Monetary policies are also likely to remain divergent. The US Fed is expected to maintain its moderate pace of tightening, dependent to some degree on the size and nature of possible fiscal reforms. Policy rates are expected to remain low in most other advanced economies, but a reduction in quantitative easing is possible in the near future in the euro area. In general, emerging market economies have displayed a loosening bias, particularly in those countries where previous policy tightening had resulted in improved inflation prospects. The high yield differentials of emerging markets have persisted, sustaining capital flows to these economies. At the time of the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand was trading at around R13.00 against the US dollar. It then depreciated following the domestic cabinet reshuffle and the consequent sovereign credit ratings downgrades by two ratings agencies. Having reached a weak point of almost R14.00 against the US dollar in April, the rand subsequently recovered some of these losses in line with improved sentiment towards emerging markets in general. Some of these gains were reversed by spill-over effects of recent political uncertainty in Brazil. Since the previous meeting the rand has appreciated by 0.4% against the US dollar and depreciated by 1.6% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels the rand is still more appreciated relative to rates prevailing at this time last year. Despite the recent weakening, the rand has been supported by a more favourable current account outlook, following a significant narrowing of the deficit in the final quarter of last year. A further positive trade balance was recorded in the first quarter of this year, but a moderately wider current account deficit is expected over the forecast period, due in part to a recent deterioration in the terms of trade. Non-residents remained net buyers of domestic government bonds in April and May to date, to the value of R23.2 billion, despite the recent ratings downgrades. This may change should further downgrades occur, particularly with respect to domestic currency ratings. The rand therefore remains vulnerable to this prospect, as well as to changes in global risk sentiment towards emerging markets. The domestic growth outlook has deteriorated amid weak business and consumer confidence. The Bank<d5>s forecast for GDP growth has been revised down for the entire forecast period, by 0.2 percentage points for 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019. Annual growth rates of 1.0%, 1.5% and 1.7% for the forecast years are now expected. This downward revision is due in part to the expected impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade on domestic private sector gross fixed capital formation in particular. The downgrade is also likely to weigh on public sector investment through higher funding costs and more difficult access to funding. At the sectoral level, a strong near-term improvement is expected in the agricultural sector, and mining output has also rebounded. By contrast, the manufacturing sector outlook remains constrained, with a third consecutive quarterly contraction expected in the first quarter of this year. In line with this, the latest ABSA Purchasing Managers Index showed a sharp decline. Growth in the trade sector also appears to have moderated somewhat.  A slower but positive pace of household consumption expenditure growth is forecast for this year. Real retail and wholesale trade sales contracted in the first quarter of this year. While domestic sales of passenger motor vehicles improved, the outlook for the sector remains subdued. Factors such as low consumer confidence, higher tax burdens, the absence of significant wealth effects and stagnant employment growth have contributed to these weaker consumption trends. In addition to these factors, credit extension to the household sector in particular remains weak, and is reflected in further household deleveraging. Although credit extension to the corporate sector is still relatively robust, the downward growth trend has persisted. There may, however, be some relief to consumers from moderating inflation, while increases in real disposable income over the forecast period are also expected to provide some support to consumption, but to a lesser extent than previously. Nominal salary and wage increases have continued to show signs of moderation, but are still at levels that contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. While continued moderation of nominal unit labour costs are expected over most of the forecast period, the trajectory has been revised slightly upwards largely due to the weaker economic growth projections. International oil prices have firmed since the previous meeting, having declined to levels below US 50 per barrel at one stage. The recovery was a response to indications that the OPEC agreement to curtail output would be extended for a further six months. However, the fragility of this agreement, and the increase in shale   production in the US is expected to cap increases going forward. The international oil price assumption has been revised down by US 2 per barrel for each forecast year, but the moderate upward trend has been maintained. Domestic petrol prices increased by around 50 cents per litre in May, due to the weaker exchange rate and higher international product prices. The current over-recovery on the petrol price indicates that a reduction of around 20 cents per litre is likely in June, mainly due to international price movements. The short-term inflation outlook has improved further since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Headline inflation in April was lower than expected, largely related to the pace of food disinflation. The MPC notes, however, that there have been broad-based downside surprises in core inflation as well. The current forecast does not incorporate the most recent outcomes, and further downside surprises in the coming months could impact of the starting point of the forecast and lower the entire trajectory. However, in the absence of such revisions, the MPC remains concerned about the persistence of the longer-term forecast trend at elevated levels within the target. This gives very little headroom to absorb the impact of possible adverse shocks. The rand remains a key upside risk to the forecast. The rand has, however, been surprisingly resilient in the face of recent domestic developments. This is partly due to offsetting factors, particularly positive sentiment towards emerging markets and the improved current account balance. The current level of the exchange rate, at below R13.00 against the dollar, is slightly stronger than at the time of the last  meeting and stronger than that implicit in the starting point for the real exchange rate assumption. The outlook for the rand, and therefore the risks to the inflation outlook, will be highly sensitive to unfolding domestic political uncertainty, as well as decisions by the credit ratings agencies. The rand could weaken significantly in the event of a worst-case ratings downgrade scenario that could result in South African government bonds falling out of the global bond indices. A downside risk may come from electricity tariffs. The increases from July may be lower than the 4.0% now assumed, given the 1.8% guideline for municipalities published by Nersa. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to this assumption for next year, when a new application from Eskom is likely. Currently an 8.0% increase is assumed from July next year. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced. Domestic demand pressures remain subdued, and, given the continued negative consumer and business sentiment, the risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9     The MPC remains of the view that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate for now and that we are likely at the end of the tightening cycle. A reduction in rates would be possible should inflation continue to surprise on the downside and the forecast over the policy horizon be sustainably within the target range. However, in the current environment of high levels of uncertainty, the risks to the outlook could easily deteriorate, and derail the current favourable assessment.

Committee the inflation outlook has improved. Food price inflation has moderated faster than expected, domestic demand pressures remain subdued and international oil prices have declined. Despite a degree of volatility, the rand exchange rate has been relatively resilient in the face of expected monetary policy tightening in some advanced economies, as well as domestic political risks and uncertainties. Risks to the inflation outlook still remain. At the same time, domestic growth prospects have deteriorated further following the surprise GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2017. The economy has now recorded two successive quarters of negative growth, and although a near-term improvement is expected, the outlook remains challenging. A number of sentiment indicators and data points have reached levels last seen during the 2009 recession, at the height of the global financial crisis. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5.4% and 5.1% in May and June, in line with the Bank<d5>s short- term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation measured 6.9% in both months, with the contribution to the overall inflation outcome unchanged at 1.2 percentage points. Meat prices continued to accelerate, and at 13.0%, contributed to the downside stickiness of food price inflation. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8% in both months. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 4.6% in April and 4.8% in May. The further moderation in food prices was reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the seventh consecutive month to 5.8%. The divergent trends between the subcategories of <d2>products of crops and horticulture<d3> and <d2>live animals<d3> persisted, with year-on-year changes of -24.4% and 21.4% respectively. The Bank<d5>s forecast for headline CPI inflation has shown a marked improvement since the previous meeting. The annual average forecast has been revised down by 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019, to 5.3%, 4.9% and 5.2%. A lower turning point of 4.6% is expected in the first quarter of 2018 (previously 5.1%), and an average of 5.2% is forecast for the final quarter of 2019. The main drivers of the improved forecast were the lower starting point; revised assumptions regarding international oil prices, domestic electricity tariffs and the real effective exchange rate; and a wider output gap. These assumptions are set out in the annexure to this statement. Food price inflation is also expected to be more subdued, due to a lower starting point and more favourable domestic crop estimates. Despite a persistent upward trend in meat price inflation, the forecast for food price inflation has been revised down from 7.7% to 7.3% for this year; and from 5.4% to 5.1% in 2018. The forecast for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%. The improvement is also evident in the core inflation outlook, with average forecasts of 4.8% for 2017 and 2018, and 4.9% for 2019. This compares with previous forecasts of 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.3% for these years. This improvement is driven in part by lower unit labour costs, in addition to the exchange rate and output gap developments. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research show a marginal improvement, with average expectations slightly below 6% in all three years. The decline was most marked among analysts, particularly over the first two survey years, and to a lesser extent among labour unionists. Both these categories of respondents expect inflation to be within the target range over the forecast period. The expectations of business respondents are largely unchanged and remain above 6% for all three years. By contrast, average 5-year expectations of all groups edged up from 5.7% to 5.9%, and ranged between 5.5% for analysts and 6.3% for business respondents. Median inflation expectations of market analysts improved over the near term. According to the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in July, expected inflation declined by 0.2 percentage points to 5.5% in 2017 and to 5.3% in 2018, compared with the May survey. However, the longer term trend is reversed with an expectation of 5.5% in 2019. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds have also declined slightly since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.3%. The global growth backdrop remains positive, with sustained upswings evident in most regions. This is despite continued uncertainty regarding economic policy reforms in    the US. Nevertheless, growth rates and potential output estimates are still generally lower than those in the pre-crisis period. While there are lingering concerns about financial stability risks from the shadow banking sector in China, the recent strong performance of the economy has contributed to the favourable environment for emerging markets. Underlying global inflation trends remain benign, with inflation below target in most of the advanced economies, notwithstanding the positive growth prognosis and tightening labour markets. An exception is the UK where inflation has accelerated in the wake of the Brexit-induced depreciation of sterling. The subdued global inflation outlook is reinforced by generally slow wage and productivity growth in developed economies. Despite the absence of inflationary pressures, central banks in a number of advanced economies have signalled intentions to move from highly accommodative monetary policy stances. These countries include the US, the UK, the euro area and Canada. This process is unlikely to be smooth or perfectly synchronised and could generate bouts of uncertainty. In the US, expectations of further near-term rate increases by the Fed have been scaled down following a succession of downside inflation surprises. The gradual nature of the planned balance sheet contraction by the Fed has also been well communicated and appears to be largely priced in by the markets. While changing expectations regarding ECB and US monetary policy in particular have impacted on a number of emerging market currencies and bond yields, the reaction has been relatively muted, and a repeat of the 2013 so-called taper tantrum episode is not expected. Those economies that were most sensitive to that episode have much improved macroeconomic balances, and their currencies are less vulnerable to    possible spill-over effects from gradual monetary tightening in the advanced economies. The rand has also been affected by these changing expectations, as well as by domestic political developments, including concerns about a proposal to change the SARB<d5>s monetary policy mandate. While the rand is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, it has been relatively volatile, having fluctuated in a range between R12.60 and R13.60 against the US dollar. The rand<d5>s relative resilience had been underpinned by the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets, as well as by sustained trade surpluses. The current account deficit is still expected to widen over the forecast period, but the degree of widening has been revised down. The rand remains vulnerable to increased global risk aversion, domestic political shocks, and to the possibility of further ratings downgrades. The domestic growth outlook remains a concern, following the surprise broad-based GDP growth contraction during the first quarter of this year. With the exception of the primary sector, all sectors recorded negative growth. While positive growth is expected in the second quarter, the Bank<d5>s annual growth forecasts have been revised down further. The forecast for 2017 has been adjusted down from 1.0% to 0.5%, and the forecast for 2018 is down from 1.5% to 1.2%. Growth of 1.5% is expected in 2019, compared with 1.7% previously. As a result of these trends, the output gap has widened somewhat despite a further downward revision to potential output growth by 0.3 percentage points for each year, to 1.1% in 2017 and rising to 1.3% in 2019. The weak outlook is consistent with the decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to levels last seen during the    recession following the global financial crisis. The SARB<d5>s composite leading business cycle indicator has also moderated somewhat since January. Monthly data for both the mining and manufacturing sectors in April and May suggest that, in the absence of a sharp contraction in June, these sectors are likely to contribute positively to growth in the second quarter, along with the continued rebound in the agricultural sector. The recovery is nevertheless expected to be modest, particularly in the light of a sharp fall in the ABSA Purchasing Mangers<d5> Index in June, which returned to below the neutral level of 50 index points. The construction sector also remains under pressure following the marked fall in building plans passed in the first quarter of this year, with the negative trend continuing into April. The continued poor performance of gross fixed capital formation contributes to the weak state of the economy. Although private sector investment recorded positive growth after five consecutive quarters of contraction, at a growth rate of 1.2% it remains very subdued. Given the extremely low level of business confidence, a near- term improvement is unlikely. Policy uncertainty, a recent example being in the mining sector, is likely to constrain investment. As a consequence, employment growth has been minimal, and the prospects are unfavourable. Given the need for fiscal consolidation, a continued decline in government<d5>s contribution to employment creation is expected. The official unemployment rate increased to 27.7% in the first quarter of this year. Consumption expenditure by households contracted in the first quarter of this year, amid a further deterioration in consumer confidence. Although the monthly retail sales data suggest a more positive outcome for the second quarter, this improvement is likely to be offset in part by a decrease in new vehicle sales in the quarter. The outlook    for consumption expenditure is expected to remain weak, amid employment uncertainty and higher tax burdens. These consumption trends are mirrored in the continued moderation in credit extension to households. Growth in mortgage advances and instalment sales credit finance remained subdued, reflective of the difficult conditions in the housing and vehicle markets. General loans to households increased moderately in May, but off a low base. Credit extension to the corporate sector, by contrast, remains relatively buoyant, but on a downward trend. Wage trends have been an important contributor to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. There are, however, indications of some moderation in average salaries, and related unit labour costs, which are expected to remain below the 6% level over the forecast period. The outcome of a number of multi-year wage agreements that are due for renewal in 2017 will be closely watched as they could pose a risk to the inflation trajectory. The persistent global oil supply glut, along with increased shale gas production in the US, have undermined efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices through output restrictions. Since the beginning of June, Brent crude oil prices have traded at levels below US 50 per barrel, and the Bank<d5>s oil price assumptions have been revised down over the forecast period. These recent oil price trends, along with the stronger exchange rate, contributed to a 69 cent per litre reduction in the petrol price in July. Following a weakening of the rand and a partial recovery in crude oil prices, a moderate petrol price increase is expected in August.    The inflation outlook has improved significantly since the previous meeting of the MPC and has been fairly broad-based. The lower core inflation outlook is indicative of weaker underlying inflation pressures, at a time when the impact of exogenous shocks on headline inflation has been dissipating. These shocks include drought-induced food price inflation and to a lesser extent international oil price increases earlier this year that have since been reversed. A number of risks to the inflation outlook persist and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be broadly balanced. Although the rand has been relatively resilient, it remains vulnerable to heightened political uncertainty, global monetary policy developments and possible further credit ratings downgrades. On the positive side, it is supported by a sustained narrowing of the current account deficit and positive investor sentiment towards emerging markets. A further upside risk relates to the possible supply side shock of a large electricity tariff increase from July next year. Eskom has approached Nersa for an increase of around 20%, but the current forecast assumes an increase of 8%. This assumption will be adjusted in line with any new determinations made by Nersa. The MPC also remains concerned that inflation expectations remain sticky at the upper end of the target range. To the extent that these expectations are formed adaptively, they should adjust downwards if the lower inflation trajectory is sustained. The MPC would prefer expectations to be anchored closer to the mid-point of the target range. Underlying demand in the economy is extremely weak and the MPC is concerned about the deterioration in the growth outlook over the forecast period. This decline is broad-based. It is unclear where the drivers of accelerated growth will come from in the absence of credible structural policy initiatives that will reduce uncertainty and increase business and consumer confidence. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside.    Given the improved inflation outlook and the deteriorated growth outlook, the MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points with effect from 21 July 2017, to 6.75% per annum. Four members preferred a reduction, while two members preferred an unchanged stance. As we have emphasised on numerous occasions, the MPC does not view monetary policy as the solution to the structural growth constraints in the economy. Nor does it believe that a reduction in interest rates will provide a significant stimulus to growth in the current environment of low confidence and political uncertainty. It will however provide some relief at the margin. In this highly uncertain environment, future policy decisions will be dependent on data outcomes and our assessment of the balance of risks. We remain vigilant and would not hesitate to reverse this decision should the inflation outlook and risks deteriorate.

during the second quarter of 2017 following two consecutive quarters of contraction. Growth prospects, however remain subdued as domestic fixed investment contracted further amid low business confidence. The inflation forecast has increased marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with increased uncertainty regarding a number of the main drivers. The global economy is on a recovery path. Inflation has moderated in the emerging economies and remains benign in most advanced economies. The FOMC statement yesterday confirmed the gradual pace of reduction of its balance sheet and normalisation of its policy rate. Along with continued accommodative policies by the ECB, this is expected to contribute to the continuation of favourable prospects for capital flows to emerging economies.    The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 4.8% in August, up from 4.6% previously, marginally below the Bank<d5>s short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation surprised on the downside, moderating from 6.8% to 5.7%. Meat prices continued to accelerate in August, having measured 15.0%, but the lower cereal prices contributed to the slowing momentum. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.7% in July and 4.6% in August in line with the short-term forecast. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods declined from 4.0% in June to 3.6% in July. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 3.3% in July, but the divergent trend of manufactured meat prices continued with an increase of 17.8%. This trend was also evident in agricultural prices, where the subcategory of <d2>live animals<d3> increased by 31.7%, while <d2>products of crops and horticulture<d3> declined by 26.9%. The Bank<d5>s forecast for headline CPI inflation is unchanged at an annual average of 5.3% in 2017, and revised up by 0.1 percentage point to 5.0% and 5.3% in 2018 and 2019. A lower turning point of 4.6% is still expected in the first quarter of 2018. The same pattern is observed in the forecast for core inflation which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, but adjusted up to 4.9% and 5.0% for the next two years. These forecasts do not incorporate the most recent inflation outcome. The main drivers of these changes are a lower repurchase rate, a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, a slightly narrower output gap and a marginal adjustment to the food price forecast as meat prices continue to surprise on the upside. Food price    inflation is forecast to reach a low turning point of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2018, and to average 7.3% in 2017, and 5.2% and 5.6% in 2018 and 2019. There may be some downside risk to this forecast in light of the August food inflation outcomes. The electricity tariff assumption remains unchanged at 8.0% from July next year, but there may be some upside risk to this assumption, given Eskom<d5>s recent application to Nersa. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2017 continue to be relatively anchored at the upper end of the target range. Despite a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the average expected inflation for 2017 to 5.7%, expectations remain unchanged at 5.8% and 5.9% for the next two years. Expectations of analysts and business people moderated - although the latter remain above the target range - while those of trade unionists increased marginally. A welcome development is that average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 5.9% to 5.6%. This is the lowest level recorded since long-term expectations were first surveyed in 2011. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.2%. Global conditions remain generally favourable despite some geopolitical risks. The upswing appears to be synchronised, with increased world trade volumes. Growth in the US is forecast to remain above potential in the short to medium term, with the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes expected to have only a limited and short- lived impact on growth. The improved growth performance in the euro area also appears to be sustained and region-wide, while the Japanese economy has    experienced moderate growth in the past few quarters. By contrast, growth in the UK has slowed, following weak investment in the face of the Brexit headwinds. The outlook for emerging markets is also relatively positive amid generally improving fundamentals. Despite the improved growth outlook, global inflation pressures remain benign, particularly in the advanced economies. These trends are likely to contribute to the persistence of accommodative monetary policy stances in Japan and the euro area, where the recent appreciation of the euro is likely to dampen inflation pressures further. As expected, the US Fed yesterday announced a gradual reduction of its balance sheet. The process had been communicated previously and was largely priced in by the financial markets. The pace of policy rate normalisation is also expected to remain measured, as inflation continues to surprise on the downside, despite tightening labour market conditions. The stance of US fiscal policy is a source of uncertainty. Although tax reductions could lead to a faster pace of monetary tightening, the prospect of significant tax reforms has receded over time. The rand exchange rate traded in a range of between R13.54 and R12.74 since the previous meeting of the MPC, driven in part by movements in the major currencies. Over this period, the rand depreciated by 2.8% against the US dollar, by 6.2% against the euro, and by 4.5% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand remains sensitive to political developments, weak economic growth prospects and the risk of further sovereign ratings downgrades. However, it has been supported by persistent trade account surpluses and associated narrowing of the current account deficit.    The rand has also been supported by the relatively accommodative global monetary policy settings. These have contributed to sustained demand for high-yielding emerging market bonds. Net purchases by non-residents of South African government bonds have amounted to R(63) billion year to date. The domestic yield curve relative to other peer emerging market economies remains attractive to non-residents despite a decline in the curve across all maturities. However, longer-term bond yields and the rand remain vulnerable to a large non-resident sell-off in the event of further credit ratings downgrades resulting in South Africa falling out of the global bond indices. The domestic economic growth outlook remains constrained despite the higher-than- expected growth outcome of 2.5% in the second quarter of this year. This broad-based improvement, while welcome, is not expected to have a significant impact on the annual growth outcome. The Bank<d5>s forecast for GDP growth for 2017 has been revised up marginally from 0.5% to 0.6%, while the forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have remained unchanged at 1.2% and 1.5%. This outlook is consistent with the Bank<d5>s leading business cycle indicator which has been weakening since the beginning of the year, indicative of muted growth prospects. Business confidence also remains at very low levels, despite the slight improvement in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index during the third quarter. All the major sectors, apart from construction, recorded positive growth in the second quarter, with a particularly strong performance in the agricultural sector. The recovery in the manufacturing sector followed three successive quarterly contractions, while the tertiary sector reversed its one quarter contraction. The limited monthly data for the third quarter present a mixed picture at this stage. Mining sector output contracted in    July while manufacturing recorded positive growth. However, the Absa PMI has averaged 43.5 index points in the first two months of the quarter, suggesting continued headwinds for the sector. The underlying weakness in the economy is evident in the 2.6% contraction in gross fixed capital formation during the second quarter. Of particular concern is the 6.9% decline in private sector fixed investment, reflecting the low levels of business confidence. This subdued outlook is expected to persist against a backdrop of continued political and policy uncertainty. These investment trends do not bode well for employment creation in the economy. Total employment declined in the second quarter of 2017 and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 27.7%. The public sector, previously the main source of employment growth in the economy, is likely to continue to shed jobs as fiscal constraints intensify. Consumption expenditure by households rebounded strongly in the second quarter following the sizeable contraction in the previous quarter. Spending on all three major goods components recovered, but expenditure on services contracted. Despite the improved outcome, the outlook for consumption expenditure growth remains subdued, although positive, amid very low levels of consumer confidence. Month-on-month retail trade sales decreased in July, but motor vehicle sales remained relatively strong in July and August. The Bank expects household consumption growth to be in the region of 1% for this year.    The underlying drivers of household consumption expenditure remains unchanged. Lower inflation, lower interest rates and higher real income growth are expected to provide some support for consumption. Offsetting effects include depressed consumer confidence, weak employment growth, the absence of significant wealth effects, and the prospect of further tax increases in the wake of fiscal revenue shortfalls. In addition, growth in credit extension to the private sector has declined steadily over the past few months, as corporate demand for mortgage finance and general loans in particular moderated. Growth in credit extension to households remains weak and negative in real terms. These trends are also reflected in continued household deleveraging, with household debt to disposable income declining further to 72.6% in the second quarter, its lowest level since the beginning of 2006. International oil prices have increased by about US 5 per barrel since the previous meeting, with Brent crude oil currently trading at around US 55 per barrel. Nevertheless, the MPC does not expect a further sustained acceleration in prices as the flexibility of US shale oil production is expected to provide a ceiling to prices. The previous oil price assumptions therefore remain unchanged. The domestic price of 95 octane petrol has increased by a cumulative 86 cents per litre since August, mainly due to higher international product prices. A further moderate increase is expected in October.    The MPC expects inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period, closer to the mid-point than was the case early in the year. Core inflation has remained relatively stable, indicative of the absence of significant demand pressures. However, a number of risks to the inflation outlook have increased and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be somewhat on the upside. The rand remains a key upside risk to the inflation outlook. Furthermore, some of the event risks, particularly those of a political nature, are now more imminent but with no greater degree of clarity regarding the outcome. The prospect of a further ratings downgrade persists, particularly given the increased fiscal challenges and political uncertainty. The narrower current account deficit and the global environment remain supportive of the rand. However, should inflation and/or growth surprise on the upside in Europe and in the US in particular, we could see a faster pace of monetary tightening, which could impact on capital flows and the rand exchange rate. At this stage, the markets appear to be pricing a high probability of an increase in the Federal funds rate in December, and three further increases next year. A further upside risk relates to the possibility of a large electricity tariff increase than is currently assumed in our forecast from July next year. A tariff increase of 20% could raise the headline inflation forecast by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points, and the MPC will continue to assess the possible second round effects of these increases. The MPC remains concerned that inflation expectations of business people and trade unions remains above or close to 6% for the next two years even though our own forecast and those of most analysts expect inflation to be much closer to 5%. Lower inflation expectations among key price setters is an important element in reducing inflation in the future, thus enabling lower nominal interest rates. Until August, food price inflation had been moderating at a slower pace than expected, mainly due to the continued acceleration in meat prices. However, the August year- on-year outcome surprised significantly on the downside. Should this lower trajectory continue, there could be a downside risk to the food price forecast, and to the overall inflation outlook, particularly in the short term. Although household consumption expenditure rebounded strongly in the second quarter, the MPC does not view this as indicative of the longer-term trend of expenditure, which is expected to remain constrained. The second quarter growth outcome, while positive, does not change our growth forecast significantly, and the outlook remains weak. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside. In light of these developments and the deteriorating assessment of the balance of the risks, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. Three members preferred an unchanged stance and three members preferred a 25 basis point reduction. Ultimately the committee decided to keep the rate unchanged. Given the heightened uncertainties in the economy, the MPC felt it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage, and reassess the data and the balance of risks at the next meeting.

Committee upside risks to the inflation outlook have increased, mainly due to higher international oil prices and a weaker rand exchange rate. Despite a deterioration in the forecast, inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period. Domestic event risks, including rating agency reviews and the economic policy implications of the ANC electoral conference, are likely to dominate rand movements over the coming weeks. The domestic growth outlook remains weak, continuing its deviation from the generally more favourable global pattern. Stronger world growth has contributed to a further increase in international oil prices, which could, in turn, provide a boost to global inflation. This may increase the pace of monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies, with possible implications for capital flows to emerging markets.    The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4.8% in October, down from 5.1% previously, marginally below the Bank<d5>s short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation continued to moderate, measuring 5.3% in October, down from 5.5% in September, but meat price inflation remained elevated at 15.5%. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.5% in October compared with 4.6% previously. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased in August and September, to 4.2% and 5.2% respectively, having recorded a low of 3.6% in July. The higher trend was driven to a large extent by higher international oil prices and a weaker exchange rate. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 1.3% in September, but manufactured meat price inflation remained elevated at 16.5%. At the agricultural level, prices of live animals increased by 26.7%, suggesting that it may take some time for meat price inflation to normalise. The inflation forecast generated by the Bank<d5>s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows a deterioration since September. The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 5.3%, but has been revised upward for 2018 and 2019 to 5.2% and 5.5%, from 5.1% and 5.4% previously. The lower turning point, which is expected in the first quarter of 2018, increased from 4.5% to 4.7%. The main upside drivers of these changes are a weaker exchange rate path in 2018 in particular, a higher international oil price, and higher average wage growth. These pressures are offset to some extent by a more favourable food price forecast in 2018 in particular. Following a number of downside surprises, food price inflation is now expected to reach a low turning point of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared    with 4.7% previously. Average increases of 4.5% and 5.9% are now expected in 2018 and 2019, compared with previous forecasts of 5.3% and 5.9%. Furthermore, the endogenously determined path of the repo rate in the QPM also provides an offsetting effect. This path implies three interest rate increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2019, compared with one increase previously. As we elaborate later, this does not imply an unconditional commitment to this policy path. The forecast for core inflation, which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, has been adjusted up by 0.2 percentage points in both 2018 and 2019 to 5.1% and 5.3% respectively. A low turning point of 4.6% is expected in the final two quarters of 2017. The expectations of market analysts, as reflected in the Reuters econometer survey, are similar to those of the Bank<d5>s forecasts, with a slight deterioration since September. The survey conducted in November shows median forecasts of 5.2% for 2018 and 5.5% for 2019. Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation linked bond yields have increased, with the 5-year break-even inflation rates now close to the upper end of the target range. The global growth outlook remains positive despite some geopolitical risks. Confidence indices in a number of countries have reached their highest levels since the global financial crisis. Nevertheless the expectation is that world growth will remain below the levels seen before the crisis. The recovery in the advanced economies appears to be most sustained in the euro area, the US and Japan, but the outlook for the UK remains constrained by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. The extent to which this positive prognosis for some advanced economies is predicated on continued monetary accommodation is still unclear.    The outlook for emerging markets remains mixed but generally favourable, with prospects for oil producers boosted by higher oil prices. There are, however, some concerns about possible headwinds from slowing momentum in the Chinese economy. Inflation pressures are mostly benign in the advanced economies although there are some incipient near-term risks from higher international oil prices. Low wage growth is seen as a brake on core inflation pressures, despite relatively tight labour market conditions. The US Fed is expected to maintain a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening, with a further policy rate increase widely expected in December. The ECB has signalled a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases from next year, but expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time. The Bank of Japan has also maintained a highly accommodative policy stance. By contrast, the Bank of England raised its Bank rate in November in response to inflation pressures driven by the depreciation of the pound. The outlook for continued capital flows to emerging markets therefore remains relatively favourable despite the slowdown in bond flows in the past few weeks. However, the risk of a faster pace of monetary tightening in the US in particular, in the event of upside inflation or growth surprises, could reduce capital flows further. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand has depreciated by 3.6% against the US dollar, by 3.0% against the euro, and by 3.3% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand recorded a weak point of around R14.55 against the US dollar in mid- November, but has recovered somewhat since then. Factors that impacted on the rand during the period included the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the ANC electoral conference in December; concerns about a faster pace of    monetary tightening in the US; the negative reaction to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS); and speculation regarding the introduction of free higher education in South Africa. These latter two factors have raised the risk of sovereign ratings downgrades, a risk that has been hanging over the rand for some time. Downgrades of domestic currency debt to sub-investment grade could lead to South African government bonds falling out of key indices which require investment grade. Such an event could trigger significant sales of domestic bonds by non-residents. Ratings reviews are expected imminently, but the extent to which any possible downgrades may already be priced in remains uncertain. The lead-up to the ANC national elective conference and its uncertain outcome, is also likely to continue to weigh on the currency. Aside from these negative factors, the rand has been given some support by the continued surpluses on the trade account of the balance of payments. The Bank<d5>s forecasts for the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP have been revised down by about half a percentage point in all three years of the forecast period, to 2.2% in 2017, and 2.9% and 3.2% in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets remains supportive of the rand. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued but positive. Both consumer and business confidence remain low and are also likely to be affected by political developments in December. The forecast for GDP growth generated by the QPM has been revised up marginally to 0.7% for 2017, but revised down to 1.2% and 1.5% for 2018 and 2019, from 1.3% and 1.7% previously. The output gap is expected to remain negative over the forecast period. The SARB<d5>s composite    leading business cycle indicator increased further in September, consistent with a mild recovery. High frequency data suggest that the main production sectors have again contributed positively to economic growth in the third quarter. However, both the mining and manufacturing sectors experienced sharp month-on-month contractions in September. The Absa PMI has increased for three consecutive months, but at 47.8 index points remains in contractionary territory. The construction sector, which recorded negative growth in the second quarter, remains weak. Of particular concern is the sharp decline in the FNB/BER civil construction index to 15 index points in the third quarter, its lowest level since 2000. This is indicative of the poor outlook for infrastructure expenditure. Employment prospects remain unfavourable. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) conducted by Statistics South Africa, year-on-year growth of total employment measured 2.3% in the third quarter of 2017. Despite this increase, the official unemployment rate was unchanged at 27.7% for the third successive quarter. Fiscal constraints point to further job losses in the public sector. The outlook for consumption expenditure by households has improved moderately, following stronger retail trade sales in the second and third quarters. Retail trade sales recorded growth of 1.4% in the third quarter, despite month-on-month contractions in July and September. New motor vehicle sales also held up relatively well during the quarter. By contrast, wholesale trade sales contracted. The <d2>Black Friday<d3> effect is likely to boost sales in the fourth quarter as well. Nevertheless consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued over the forecast period.    Favourable drivers of real consumption expenditure include positive real income and wage growth, and some positive wealth effects from higher equity prices. Although growth in credit extension to households remains negative in real terms, it has increased in recent months. Constraining factors include higher tax burdens, low employment growth and weak consumer confidence. Wage growth continues to contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Although the year-on-year pace of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy declined in the second quarter of this year, at 6.1% it was still positive in real terms. Adjusting for labour productivity, growth in nominal unit labour costs measured 6.0% in the second quarter. Unit labour cost increases are forecast to remain above the 6% level over the forecast period. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7.6% in the first 9 months of 2017. The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) published in October revealed a rapidly deteriorating fiscal position. Significant revisions were made to the expected deficits and government debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. This deterioration was mainly a result of significantly lower tax revenues, although there was also a provision for a moderate breach of the expenditure ceiling. The less favourable path of fiscal consolidation could potentially reduce the scope for further monetary policy accommodation. International oil prices have re-emerged as an upside risk to domestic and global inflation. Having reached recent lows of around US 45 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has fluctuated in the US 60-US 65 per barrel range since late    October. This is in response to increased demand, and reportedly high compliance with the output restriction agreement brokered by OPEC. While we still expect the flexibility of the shale oil producers in the US to limit the further upside potential, oil prices are expected to remain at these elevated levels for some time. The oil price assumptions in the Bank<d5>s models have accordingly been increased moderately for both 2018 and 2019. The combination of a weaker exchange rate and higher product prices has resulted in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices by R1.00 per litre since September. The current under-recovery suggests a further increase in the region of 70 cents per litre is likely in December. The latest inflation outcomes show that headline inflation remains close to the midpoint of the target range, while core inflation has reached its lowest level in five years. However, the forecasts suggest that both measures are close to their lower turning points, and an upward trajectory is expected to begin early next year. Although inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, the risks to the outlook are assessed to be on the upside at a time when imminent key event risks contribute to an environment of particularly elevated uncertainty. These event risks affect monetary policy primarily through the exchange rate channel. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the deterioration in the fiscal stance has increased the risk of a sovereign ratings downgrade of domestic currency bonds to sub-investment grade. As noted, this could precipitate a significant sell-off of domestic government bonds by non-residents, with implications for the exchange rate and long-term bond yields. Should this occur, there is the possibility of a short-    term overreaction, and a possible partial recovery later on. The precise path and duration is highly uncertain. International oil prices have become an increasing concern. While we have adjusted our assumptions in this regard upward, a persistence of oil prices at current levels or higher pose an upside risk to the forecast. As before, a sizeable electricity tariff increase also remains a risk. We should have clarity on Eskom<d5>s tariff application by the time of the next MPC meeting. There are very few signs of domestic demand pressures, as reflected in core inflation outcomes. Although retail sales have surprised on the upside, household consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued. The economic growth outlook remains constrained, as weak confidence continues to weigh on investment expenditure. Business and consumer confidence are likely to be sensitive to the political outcomes in December. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth outlook to be on the downside. In light of the high degree of uncertainty prevailing in the economy and the balance of risks, the MPC has decided that it would be prudent to maintain the current stance of monetary policy at this stage. Accordingly, the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 6.75% per annum. The QPM generates an endogenous interest path that implies an increase in the repo rate of 75 basis points by the end of 2019. We need to stress that this does not mean an unconditional commitment to change policy rates in line with this path. The forecasts and implied path are a broad guide to policy and not necessarily prescriptive. Depending on economic conditions, the MPC may choose to diverge from the suggested path and alternative paths could be generated that are still    consistent with achieving the inflation target. Collective judgement therefore remains critical. As always, MPC members needs to weigh the risks to the forecasts and assess the trade-offs. It is also the case that the implied path can change from meeting to meeting as the data and risks change.

                                                                          | Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the near-term inflation outlook has deteriorated, but the longer-term outlook is more or less unchanged. The expected inflation profile has been negatively affected by higher international oil prices and a persistence in elevated food price inflation despite improved rainfall in many of the drought-stricken regions. At the same time, the rand has displayed some resilience. While some of the key risks to the rand appear to have subsided for now, they could re-emerge at any stage. Global growth prospects are mixed amid policy uncertainty, primarily in the US and the UK. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, although a modest improvement is expected over the forecast period. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,8 per cent in December, up from 6,6 per cent in November. The December outcome surprised on the upside relative to the Bank<d5>s forecast and the market consensus expectation of 6,5 per cent. The main sources of this surprise included food prices, housing rentals, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels. Food price inflation remained elevated at 12,0 per cent in December, matching the recent high recorded in October 2016. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome has remained unchanged at 1,8 percentage points for the past 3 months. Goods price inflation measured 7,8 per cent in December, up from 7,7 per cent in November, while services price inflation increased from 5,6 per cent to 5,9 per cent. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,9 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 6,9 per cent in November, compared with 6,6 per cent in October. The main contributor to the November outcome was the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 3,9 percentage points. The inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to only return to within the target range during the final quarter of 2017, and to average 6,2 per cent for the year, compared with 5,8 per cent in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2018 is more or less unchanged at an average of 5,5 per cent. The peak of the forecast remains at 6,6 per cent, which was recorded in the final quarter of 2016, and this level is now expected to persist in the first quarter of 2017. This deterioration is mainly due to changed assumptions regarding international oil prices, the domestic fuel prices and the outlook for food prices, which more than offset the more favourable exchange rate assumption.By contrast, the forecast for core inflation is unchanged, averaging 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research during the fourth quarter of 2016 showed average inflation expectations for 2017 declining from 6,0 per cent in the third quarter to 5,8 per cent. The same outcome is expected for 2018, as well as for 5-year inflation expectations. Despite the slight moderation, expectations remain more or less anchored at the upper end of the target range, but with a narrower divergence between the different groups of respondents than is usually the case. The expectations of these groups ranged from 5,6 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2017, and from 5,4 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2018. The outcome may have been distorted by the marked decline of 0,6 percentage points for the trade union respondents. The median annual inflation expectations of market analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey are relatively unchanged at 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent for 2017 and 2018. Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates declined across all maturities since the previous meeting, though remain above the target range. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, despite increased optimism regarding US growth following the US presidential elections. There is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the policies of the new administration, particularly with respect to the size of the promised fiscal stimulus. While some of the initial optimism has since been tempered somewhat, US growth is expected to be relatively strong, but with some downside risks posed by a stronger dollar. Uncertainty also persists regarding the prospects for the UK economy, as the terms of the disengagement from the EU are unlikely to be resolved for some time. The steady but slow growth recovery in the Eurozone is expected to continue, but upcoming elections in a number of countries could pose risks to the outlook, alongside ongoing concerns about the prospects for the Italian economy. The outlook for emerging markets is also unclear, given conflicting developments. Commodity prices, especially industrial commodities, have risen in recent months, but protectionist threats from the US, if carried through, could undermine world trade and have an adverse effect on emerging markets in particular. These countries are also highly dependent on Chinese growth, which is expected to remain above the 6 per cent level. However, given the credit-driven nature of recent Chinese growth, there are fears of an unsustainable credit bubble which could expose financial sector vulnerabilities, and undermine the growth outlook. There are tentative signs of global inflation edging up, as fears of deflation recede amid higher energy and food prices. As expected, the US Fed tightened monetary policy in December, and signalled further increases to come. However, the pace of increase is still expected to be relatively moderate amid a highly uncertain economic policy environment. Both the ECB and the Bank of Japan have maintained their highly accommodative policy stances. This divergence between the advanced economies is likely to persist for some time. The rand has displayed a degree of resilience since the previous meeting of the MPC, having traded in a relatively narrow range of between R14,22 and R13,46 against the US dollar. Since the previous meeting, the rand has appreciated by 5,6 per cent against the US dollar and by 4,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand was positively impacted by the decisions of the ratings agencies not to downgrade the sovereign foreign credit rating to sub-investment grade, although this remains a risk in the coming months. The limited response of the rand exchange rate to the increase in the US policy rate in mid-December suggests that the move had been largely priced in. A gradual pace of tightening is expected in the US, with the rand vulnerable to any upside surprises in this respect. The rand has been positively affected by the improvement in the terms of trade, following the recent modest increase in commodity prices. Although the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow over the forecast period, it remains relatively wide. In line with the recent improved capital flows to emerging economy bond markets, non-residents have been net buyers of South African bonds since the beginning of the year, while equity net sales have continued. This follows persistent net sales of both bonds and equities during the last three months of 2016. The domestic growth outlook remains weak and more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The Bank expects growth to have averaged 0,4 per cent in 2016, although recent monthly data for the fourth quarter suggest that there may be a downside risk to this forecast. The forecast for 2017 has been revised down marginally to 1,1 per cent (from 1,2 per cent), and remains unchanged at 1,6 per cent for 2018. This improved outlook relative to 2016 is consistent with the recent upward trend in the composite leading indicator of the Bank. By contrast, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined again in the fourth quarter, following a recovery in the previous quarter. Much of this decline was driven by the new vehicle sector. The recent monthly data paint a bleak picture for the fourth quarter of 2016. Mining production, which had improved in the second and third quarters, contracted in both October and November. However, improved commodity prices are expected to help the sector in the coming months. The manufacturing sector recorded low but positive growth in November, following a month-to-month decline in October. The Barclays Purchasing Managers<d5> Index (PMI) declined further in December, and recorded its fifth consecutive month below the neutral 50 level. The low level of business confidence is reflected in the continued, but slower, contraction in real gross fixed capital formation. Gross fixed investment has contracted for four consecutive quarters, and has been particularly marked in the private sector. This has contributed to the persistent labour market weakness, with formal non-agricultural employment (excluding temporary election-related employment) remaining unchanged in the year to the third quarter of 2016. The official unemployment rate increased to 27,1 per cent, its highest level since the inception of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey in 2008. Wage growth appears to be responding to the weak labour market environment. Year-on-year nominal wage growth per worker moderated for a fifth consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2016, down to 5,8 per cent. Following a small decline in labour productivity growth, nominal unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sector increased to 5,7 per cent. The slower nominal wage growth per worker is consistent with the lower wage settlement rates reported by Andrew Levy Employment Publications. Household consumption expenditure data paint a mixed picture. Growth in household consumption expenditure accelerated to 2,6 per cent in the third quarter despite a further contraction in durable goods consumption. Real retail trade sales declined in October, but increased markedly in November on a month-to-month basis. By contrast wholesale trade sales contracted in both months. Domestic new vehicle sales remained subdued following further declines in the final quarter of last year. Notwithstanding some improvement, consumers remain under pressure and consumer confidence remains low, as indicated in the sharp contraction in the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index in the fourth quarter. Households remain highly indebted despite a further moderation in the debt ratio, and the subdued housing and equity markets have contributed to an absence of strong wealth effects. Slower wage growth along with stagnant employment growth and expected tax increases in the forthcoming budget are also likely to dampen consumption expenditure. A further constraint to consumption expenditure growth has been the weak credit extension to the private sector, which, at 4,5 per cent in November, was the lowest year-on-year growth since late 2010. While growth in credit extension to the household sector was particularly subdued, that to the corporate sector also moderated in the second half of 2016. The strongest decline was seen in mortgage credit extension for commercial property. Food price inflation is expected to decline following good rainfall in parts of the country. Spot prices for both maize and wheat have declined significantly, and a markedly higher maize crop is expected this year. However, the impact on prices at the consumer level are yet to be felt, with meat prices likely to lag other food price categories as farmers restock their herds. Although the Bank<d5>s inflation forecast assumes that food price inflation has more or less peaked, the pace of moderation is expected to be slower than in the previous forecast. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7,0 per cent during 2017, compared with 6,5 per cent previously. Food price disinflation is expected to be constrained or delayed by higher fuel costs and a rising trend in global food prices. Brent crude oil prices increased by over 20 per cent to almost US 60 per barrel in response to the OPEC-brokered agreement to restrict production. Prices have since moderated to current levels of around US 55 per barrel. The sustainability of this agreement and its longer-term impact on prices is uncertain, given the possibility of offsetting developments. A number of oil producers were exempt from the agreement; there are incentives and scope for cartel members to exceed their quotas; and US shale producers have already increased production in response to higher prices. These factors are likely to constrain oil price increases. While the Bank<d5>s oil price assumption has been revised up, the trajectory is relatively flat. Despite the stronger rand exchange rate, the domestic price of 93 octane petrol increased by 50 cents per litre in January, and a further increase can be expected in February. The MPC has noted the marked deterioration in the inflation forecast since the previous meeting, as well as the extension of the expected breach of the upper level of the target range by a further two quarters. Inflation is now expected to return to within the target range in the final quarter of 2017. While this is a cause for concern, the main drivers of this deterioration are supply side shocks, in particular oil and food prices. The increase in the international oil price is not expected to be a start of a new oil price spiral. Various supply side factors are expected to constrain oil prices going forward in the absence of any major global political risks that would threaten production. While the food price forecast has been adversely affected by higher input costs, a steady decline in food price inflation is still expected. The more favourable rand exchange rate has been an important factor in offsetting some of the negative impacts of these developments. Despite a turbulent second half of 2016, both domestically and globally, the rand has been relatively resilient. Furthermore, the current level of the rand is stronger than that implicit in the forecast, and pass-through to inflation continues to be relatively muted. Nevertheless it remains vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks. As always, the approach of the Committee is to look through the first-round effects of exogenous shocks, but remain focused on the possible emergence of second-round effects which could require a policy response. At this stage, the longer-term trajectory over the relevant policy horizon is unchanged, as is the forecast for core inflation. In particular, the MPC will take note of possible changes in the longer-term inflation expectations, which had shown tentative signs of moderation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside. The domestic growth outlook has remained largely unchanged despite a possible weaker outcome in the fourth quarter of 2016. While some improvement is anticipated over the forecast period, growth is expected to remain below potential. The risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be broadly balanced. Growth prospects remain dependent on uncertain but tentatively improving global conditions, and their impact on commodity prices. Domestically, some improvement in agricultural production can be expected. However, a significant improvement in growth prospects requires the implementation of structural reforms which could contribute to increased business and consumer confidence. In light of these developments and the assessment of the balance of risks, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains focused on the medium- to longer-term inflation outlook, but the deterioration of the shorter-term outlook requires increased vigilance. Furthermore, the MPC remains concerned that the longer-term inflation trajectory continues to be uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The Committee retains the view that we may be near the end of the hiking cycle. However, should second- round effects emerge that undermine the longer-term inflation outlook, there may be a reassessment of this view. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR | \n",

                                                                          | Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the inflation outlook has improved. This was mainly due to the further appreciation of the rand exchange rate following the benign market reaction to the US Fed monetary policy tightening, as well as the significant narrowing of the domestic current account deficit. A more positive growth outlook in the advanced economies has also contributed to a more favourable environment for emerging markets generally. However, the recent heightened domestic political uncertainty has reversed some of these exchange rate gains, and the risk of further rand weakening overshadows the inflation outlook. Domestic growth prospects remain constrained, although the low point of the cycle is probably behind us. Demand pressures are expected to remain weak amid low business and consumer confidence. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.3% in February, from 6.6% in January, in line with the market consensus expectation. Food price inflation, which measured 10.0%, moderated for the second consecutive month following its recent peak of 12.0% in December. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.9 percentage points in January to 1.7 percentage points in February. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5.2%, down from 5.5%. This follows a recent peak of 5.9% in December 2016. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5.6% in February compared with 5.9% in January. The category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerated for the sixth consecutive month to 8.4%, following its recent peak of 13.4% in August last year. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved, reversing most of the deterioration seen at the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter previously, and to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. CPI inflation is expected to average 5.9% for the year, compared with 6.2% in the previous forecast, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated from an average of 5.5% to 5.4%. The forecast period has been extended to 2019, with an expected average of 5.5% for the year. This improvement is mainly due to a more appreciated exchange rate assumption. Despite the recent depreciation, the current level of the rand is still consistent with the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. Although the international oil price  assumption remains unchanged, the exchange rate is expected to lead to lower petrol price inflation, and is reflected in a downward revision to the assumption for administered prices. This favourable trend is partially offset by a slower pace of disinflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages, driven by an expected acceleration in poultry prices in particular. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7.4% and 5.2% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.0% and 5.0% previously. The forecast for core inflation is marginally lower than before at an average of 5.4% in 2017, and unchanged at 5.2% in 2018. An average core inflation of 5.3% is expected in 2019. Inflation expectations as measured by the Bureau for Economic Research show a deterioration over the near-term in particular. The average expectation for 2017 has increased from 5.8% to 6.2%, with the largest upward revisions coming from businesses and labour respondents. The average expectation for 2018 increased marginally from 5.8% to 5.9%, while the expected inflation for 2019 is 6.0%. By contrast, average inflation expectations over five years declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.7%. Median inflation expectations of economic analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in March, are more or less unchanged since January. Inflation is expected to average 5.8% in 2017, and 5.5% and 5.4% in the coming two years, roughly in line with the Bank<d5>s forecast. Inflation expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation linked bonds) had declined since the previous meeting, but have since spiked following the recent depreciation of the rand, and remain above the 6.0% level for longer-dated maturities. The global economy shows continued signs of a broad-based improvement. The growth outlook in the US remains favourable with business confidence indices at high levels. However, there is growing uncertainty about the timing and size of the expected fiscal stimulus. Tax reform may take longer than anticipated following the recent failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Growth prospects in Japan and Europe are also more promising, with the PMI reaching a six-year high in the euro area, led by the services sectors in France and Germany. The extent to which the sustainability of this improvement is dependent on the highly accommodative monetary policy stance is still unclear. The outlook for emerging markets is also more positive, in part driven by the recovery in the advanced economies, and stronger demand in China. Firmer commodity prices have also helped, but an oversupply of some commodities could limit these gains. Global inflation provides a mixed picture with the recent decline in international oil prices threatening to reverse the broad-based increases in headline inflation in the advanced economies. Some inflation normalisation is evident in the US and the euro area, but Japan is showing less momentum in price and wage growth. Inflation in the UK is expected to overshoot the target for some time, as the economy adjusts to a weaker currency. Similarly, inflation experiences in a number of emerging economies have reflected divergent currency movements. The US Fed raised its policy rate in March in response to the stronger inflation trend and improved growth outlook. While this action was widely expected, the gradual nature of the expected interest rate cycle implicit in the forward guidance surprised the markets. Policy rates are expected to remain at low levels for some time in most of the advanced economies until more favourable inflation and growth dynamics are more firmly entrenched. For the past few months the rand exchange rate had been relatively resilient, along with a number of other emerging market currencies. While most measures of emerging market risk have narrowed over recent months, those for South Africa have widened again over the past few days. The rand has depreciated significantly in response to increased domestic political uncertainty and the exchange rate has re- emerged as an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by 3.9% against the US dollar, by 4.0% against the euro and by 3.4% on a trade-weighted basis. The prospect of US monetary policy tightening had been seen as a risk to the exchange rate. However, the rand and other peer currencies strengthened in response to the Fed actions in March, indicative of revised market expectations of a more moderate tightening cycle than that priced in. The rand has also been underpinned by favourable terms of trade trends. Furthermore, the improving trend of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments has reduced the perceived vulnerability of the rand to possible capital flow reversals. However, while significant adjustment of the current account has occurred, the deficit is not expected to remain at the level seen in the fourth quarter of last year. The domestic growth outlook remains weak following the negative growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2016 annual GDP growth of 0.3% is likely to have been the low point of the growth cycle, and a mild recovery is expected over the forecast period. The Bank<d5>s forecast for GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points in both 2017 and 2018, to 1.2% and 1.7%, with growth of 2.0% forecast for 2019. While growth is still expected to be below estimated potential output growth of around 1.4% in the near term, the output gap is expected to narrow to some extent in the later part of the forecast period. The more favourable growth outlook is consistent with the Bank<d5>s leading indicator of economic activity which has increased for six consecutive months. The main drivers of growth are expected to be net exports and positive, albeit weak, household consumption expenditure growth. Some impetus is expected to come from fixed capital formation in the outer period of the forecast. At a sectoral level, the agricultural sector is expected to return to positive growth following good rains in a number of regions and improved maize crop estimates. A modest recovery in the manufacturing sector is expected following two consecutive months of the Absa PMI being above the neutral 50 point level, while the mining sector is forecast to respond to more favourable commodity prices. Low growth in gross fixed capital formation remains a downside risk to growth in the short term. In 2016 gross fixed capital formation contracted for the first time since 2010, with the ratio of fixed capital formation to GDP declining from 20.4% in 2015 to 19.6% in 2016. Private sector investment remains particularly weak, having contracted for five successive quarters. This is reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which increased marginally in the first quarter of 2017, but at 40 index points remains well below the neutral level of 50. The BER Manufacturing survey shows a sharp decline in expected capital investment over the next 12 months, with the political climate cited as the main reason.  The constrained growth outlook does not bode well for employment creation in the economy. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, employment increased by 0.3% while the number of unemployed grew by 11.3%. This resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate by 2.0 percentage points to 26.5%. Consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 0.8% in 2016 remains subdued amid low consumer confidence. While growth of 2.2% was recorded in both of the final two quarters of the 2016, negative retail and wholesale trade sales growth in December and January underscore the likely persistence of this weakness. New vehicle sales continued to decline in February, although exports increased significantly. These trends are expected to persist as the impact of a higher tax burden, low employment growth and weak wealth effects take their toll on consumption expenditure. In addition, credit extension by banks to the private sector continues to grow at low rates, particularly to households amid a further decline in the household debt to disposable income ratio. Expenditure will be supported to some extent by positive but moderate real income growth. Fiscal policy as outlined in the recent budget remains committed to a steady pace of deficit reduction over the next three years. Lower tax revenues relative to budget <d0> partly a consequence of slower economic growth <d0> have resulted in a shortfall to be filled by a combination of lower expenditure growth, increased fuel levies and other excise duties, and a number of tax changes. These include limited compensation for fiscal drag and a higher marginal tax bracket for high-income earners. The tax   increases are expected to act as a drag on household consumption expenditure, particularly for middle and upper income earners. International oil prices have declined following increased oil inventories and weak compliance with the OPEC-brokered deal to restrict output, and an increase in shale gas production in the US. Although Brent crude oil prices increased by about 10% in the wake of this agreement, these gains have been largely reversed, with oil prices back in the region of US 50 per barrel for the past three weeks. The impact on the domestic petrol price will be evident in April when a reduction is expected, despite the 39 cent increase in the Road Accident Fund and fuel levies provided for in the February budget. Since the previous MPC meeting the inflation outlook has improved. However, the risk to the inflation forecast has been affected by the reaction of the of the exchange rate to the current elevated levels of political uncertainty. At current levels of around R13.00 against the US dollar, the exchange rate is still moderately stronger than the level implied in the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. However, the rand is likely to react further to unfolding developments until a greater degree of certainty and confidence is restored. The possibility of significant overshooting of the exchange rate in the short run also cannot be ruled out. As always, the MPC will attempt to <d2>look through<d3> short term fluctuations and focus on longer term trends in its policy settings.  The MPC remains concerned about the elevated level of inflation expectations. While the near-term reversal was not unexpected, given the deterioration of the short-term inflation outlook in January, the longer term expectations remain anchored uncomfortably at the upper end of the target range. Not all the inflation risk factors are on the upside. The deterioration in the forecast at the previous meeting was due in part to a higher international oil price assumption. This assumption has not been adjusted to reflect the recent market developments. There is a downside risk to this assumption, given the possibility of these more moderate trends persisting. A further downside risk comes from electricity price increases, which could turn out to be lower than the 8.0% currently in the forecast from mid-2017. The final price determination by the energy regulator is yet to be announced. Overall, the MPC assesses the risk to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside, mainly due to the high degree of exchange rate uncertainty. The MPC sees no evidence of significant demand pressures impacting on inflation. The growth outlook remains disappointing, and the MPC is concerned that increased political uncertainty could impact negatively on private sector investment and household consumption expenditure, and further undermine employment growth. The risks to the growth outlook are therefore assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance and one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9     The MPC is of the view that we may have reached the end of the tightening cycle. However the Committee would like to see a more sustained improvement in the inflation outlook before reducing rates. This assessment may however change if the inflation outlook and the risks to the outlook deteriorate.

                                                                          | Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Headline inflation has now returned to within the target range as expected, with outcomes in March and April surprising on the downside. While the inflation outlook has improved over the near term, the longer-term forecast trajectory is unchanged and uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The rand exchange rate and domestic bond yields benefited from increased global capital inflows to emerging markets which largely offset the impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade. With further ratings decisions imminent, risks remain for a further depreciation against the backdrop of continued global and domestic political uncertainty. 1      Domestic economic growth prospects have deteriorated, as the impact of the ratings downgrade is expected to weigh on domestic investment and consumer sentiment over the forecast period. The output gap is estimated to have widened, and consumer demand has weakened. However, the trajectory of the growth forecast is still positive, and the growth rate for this year is expected to exceed that recorded in 2016. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.1% and 5.3% in March and April. Food price inflation was the main contributor to the downside surprise in April when it measured 6.6%. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.5 percentage points in March to 1.1 percentage points. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8%, down from 4.9%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods also surprised on the downside at 4.6% in April compared with 5.2% in March. The further moderation in food prices was also reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the sixth consecutive month to 6.4%. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved over the near term, but is unchanged in the outer quarters. In line with the previous forecast, headline consumer price inflation is expected to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. Inflation is expected to average 5.7% this year compared with 5.9% previously, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated by 0.1 percentage point to 5.3%. The forecast average for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%.  The improvement is driven by downward revisions to international oil price and domestic electricity tariff assumptions. In the latter case, a tariff increase of 4.0% with effect from July 2017 is assumed, down from 8.0%. These revisions have been offset to some extent by a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, and a slower decline in food price inflation. A continued moderation of food prices is expected over the medium term given the favourable agricultural outlook and significant upward revisions to the maize crop estimates. Food price inflation is expected to average 7.7% and 5.4% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.4% and 5.2% previously, and unchanged at 5.5% in 2019. The forecast for core inflation in 2017 is 0.4 percentage points lower at 5.0%, partly due to the lower starting point of 0.2 percentage points following the sizeable downside surprise in March. The forecast for 2018 declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%, and is unchanged at 5.3% in 2019. Market-based inflation expectations are largely unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, with the median forecasts in the latest Reuters Econometer survey similar to those of the Bank. The median expectation for 2017 declined marginally to 5.7%, and is unchanged at 5.5% and 5.4% for the next two years. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates in the bond market have also moderated since the previous meeting. Break-even inflation rates for shorter-dated maturities are below 6% but higher than this level for longer-dated maturities. The global growth outlook continues to show signs of sustained recovery amid rising world trade volumes. Nevertheless, the trend growth rate is expected to be lower than that experienced before the global financial crisis. The current recovery is characterised by downward revisions to potential output growth in numerous countries, and generally low levels of productivity and wage growth. Despite a weak first quarter, US growth is expected to average above 2.0% this year, although further policy uncertainty could undermine investor and consumer confidence. Growth rates in the euro area and Japan are expected to be sustained at around 2016 levels, supported by accommodative monetary policies. The outlook for emerging markets is also generally positive. Concerns about Chinese growth have dissipated somewhat following policy intervention, but high leverage in the financial sector remains a risk. While Russia has emerged from recession, the expected recovery in Brazil may be undermined by current political uncertainty. The outlook for commodity producers may be tempered by recent weaker commodity price trends, particularly those of iron ore and coal. Global inflation remains relatively benign although country experiences differ. Inflation is below target in most of the advanced economies, apart from the UK, and the risk of deflation is low except in Japan. Where high inflation rates are being experienced in a number of emerging markets, these are generally driven by exchange rate shocks rather than underlying global price pressures. Monetary policies are also likely to remain divergent. The US Fed is expected to maintain its moderate pace of tightening, dependent to some degree on the size and nature of possible fiscal reforms. Policy rates are expected to remain low in most other advanced economies, but a reduction in quantitative easing is possible in the near future in the euro area. In general, emerging market economies have displayed a loosening bias, particularly in those countries where previous policy tightening had resulted in improved inflation prospects. The high yield differentials of emerging markets have persisted, sustaining capital flows to these economies. At the time of the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand was trading at around R13.00 against the US dollar. It then depreciated following the domestic cabinet reshuffle and the consequent sovereign credit ratings downgrades by two ratings agencies. Having reached a weak point of almost R14.00 against the US dollar in April, the rand subsequently recovered some of these losses in line with improved sentiment towards emerging markets in general. Some of these gains were reversed by spill-over effects of recent political uncertainty in Brazil. Since the previous meeting the rand has appreciated by 0.4% against the US dollar and depreciated by 1.6% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels the rand is still more appreciated relative to rates prevailing at this time last year. Despite the recent weakening, the rand has been supported by a more favourable current account outlook, following a significant narrowing of the deficit in the final quarter of last year. A further positive trade balance was recorded in the first quarter of this year, but a moderately wider current account deficit is expected over the forecast period, due in part to a recent deterioration in the terms of trade. Non-residents remained net buyers of domestic government bonds in April and May to date, to the value of R23.2 billion, despite the recent ratings downgrades. This may change should further downgrades occur, particularly with respect to domestic currency ratings. The rand therefore remains vulnerable to this prospect, as well as to changes in global risk sentiment towards emerging markets. The domestic growth outlook has deteriorated amid weak business and consumer confidence. The Bank<d5>s forecast for GDP growth has been revised down for the entire forecast period, by 0.2 percentage points for 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019. Annual growth rates of 1.0%, 1.5% and 1.7% for the forecast years are now expected. This downward revision is due in part to the expected impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade on domestic private sector gross fixed capital formation in particular. The downgrade is also likely to weigh on public sector investment through higher funding costs and more difficult access to funding. At the sectoral level, a strong near-term improvement is expected in the agricultural sector, and mining output has also rebounded. By contrast, the manufacturing sector outlook remains constrained, with a third consecutive quarterly contraction expected in the first quarter of this year. In line with this, the latest ABSA Purchasing Managers Index showed a sharp decline. Growth in the trade sector also appears to have moderated somewhat.  A slower but positive pace of household consumption expenditure growth is forecast for this year. Real retail and wholesale trade sales contracted in the first quarter of this year. While domestic sales of passenger motor vehicles improved, the outlook for the sector remains subdued. Factors such as low consumer confidence, higher tax burdens, the absence of significant wealth effects and stagnant employment growth have contributed to these weaker consumption trends. In addition to these factors, credit extension to the household sector in particular remains weak, and is reflected in further household deleveraging. Although credit extension to the corporate sector is still relatively robust, the downward growth trend has persisted. There may, however, be some relief to consumers from moderating inflation, while increases in real disposable income over the forecast period are also expected to provide some support to consumption, but to a lesser extent than previously. Nominal salary and wage increases have continued to show signs of moderation, but are still at levels that contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. While continued moderation of nominal unit labour costs are expected over most of the forecast period, the trajectory has been revised slightly upwards largely due to the weaker economic growth projections. International oil prices have firmed since the previous meeting, having declined to levels below US 50 per barrel at one stage. The recovery was a response to indications that the OPEC agreement to curtail output would be extended for a further six months. However, the fragility of this agreement, and the increase in shale   production in the US is expected to cap increases going forward. The international oil price assumption has been revised down by US 2 per barrel for each forecast year, but the moderate upward trend has been maintained. Domestic petrol prices increased by around 50 cents per litre in May, due to the weaker exchange rate and higher international product prices. The current over-recovery on the petrol price indicates that a reduction of around 20 cents per litre is likely in June, mainly due to international price movements. The short-term inflation outlook has improved further since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Headline inflation in April was lower than expected, largely related to the pace of food disinflation. The MPC notes, however, that there have been broad-based downside surprises in core inflation as well. The current forecast does not incorporate the most recent outcomes, and further downside surprises in the coming months could impact of the starting point of the forecast and lower the entire trajectory. However, in the absence of such revisions, the MPC remains concerned about the persistence of the longer-term forecast trend at elevated levels within the target. This gives very little headroom to absorb the impact of possible adverse shocks. The rand remains a key upside risk to the forecast. The rand has, however, been surprisingly resilient in the face of recent domestic developments. This is partly due to offsetting factors, particularly positive sentiment towards emerging markets and the improved current account balance. The current level of the exchange rate, at below R13.00 against the dollar, is slightly stronger than at the time of the last  meeting and stronger than that implicit in the starting point for the real exchange rate assumption. The outlook for the rand, and therefore the risks to the inflation outlook, will be highly sensitive to unfolding domestic political uncertainty, as well as decisions by the credit ratings agencies. The rand could weaken significantly in the event of a worst-case ratings downgrade scenario that could result in South African government bonds falling out of the global bond indices. A downside risk may come from electricity tariffs. The increases from July may be lower than the 4.0% now assumed, given the 1.8% guideline for municipalities published by Nersa. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to this assumption for next year, when a new application from Eskom is likely. Currently an 8.0% increase is assumed from July next year. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced. Domestic demand pressures remain subdued, and, given the continued negative consumer and business sentiment, the risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9     The MPC remains of the view that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate for now and that we are likely at the end of the tightening cycle. A reduction in rates would be possible should inflation continue to surprise on the downside and the forecast over the policy horizon be sustainably within the target range. However, in the current environment of high levels of uncertainty, the risks to the outlook could easily deteriorate, and derail the current favourable assessment.

outlook has improved. Food price inflation has moderated faster than expected, domestic demand pressures remain subdued and international oil prices have declined. Despite a degree of volatility, the rand exchange rate has been relatively resilient in the face of expected monetary policy tightening in some advanced economies, as well as domestic political risks and uncertainties. Risks to the inflation outlook still remain. At the same time, domestic growth prospects have deteriorated further following the surprise GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2017. The economy has now recorded two successive quarters of negative growth, and although a near-term improvement is expected, the outlook remains challenging. A number of sentiment indicators and data points have reached levels last seen during the 2009 recession, at the height of the global financial crisis. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5.4% and 5.1% in May and June, in line with the Bank<d5>s short- term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation measured 6.9% in both months, with the contribution to the overall inflation outcome unchanged at 1.2 percentage points. Meat prices continued to accelerate, and at 13.0%, contributed to the downside stickiness of food price inflation. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8% in both months. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 4.6% in April and 4.8% in May. The further moderation in food prices was reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the seventh consecutive month to 5.8%. The divergent trends between the subcategories of <d2>products of crops and horticulture<d3> and <d2>live animals<d3> persisted, with year-on-year changes of -24.4% and 21.4% respectively. The Bank<d5>s forecast for headline CPI inflation has shown a marked improvement since the previous meeting. The annual average forecast has been revised down by 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019, to 5.3%, 4.9% and 5.2%. A lower turning point of 4.6% is expected in the first quarter of 2018 (previously 5.1%), and an average of 5.2% is forecast for the final quarter of 2019. The main drivers of the improved forecast were the lower starting point; revised assumptions regarding international oil prices, domestic electricity tariffs and the real effective exchange rate; and a wider output gap. These assumptions are set out in the annexure to this statement. Food price inflation is also expected to be more subdued, due to a lower starting point and more favourable domestic crop estimates. Despite a persistent upward trend in meat price inflation, the forecast for food price inflation has been revised down from 7.7% to 7.3% for this year; and from 5.4% to 5.1% in 2018. The forecast for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%. The improvement is also evident in the core inflation outlook, with average forecasts of 4.8% for 2017 and 2018, and 4.9% for 2019. This compares with previous forecasts of 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.3% for these years. This improvement is driven in part by lower unit labour costs, in addition to the exchange rate and output gap developments. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research show a marginal improvement, with average expectations slightly below 6% in all three years. The decline was most marked among analysts, particularly over the first two survey years, and to a lesser extent among labour unionists. Both these categories of respondents expect inflation to be within the target range over the forecast period. The expectations of business respondents are largely unchanged and remain above 6% for all three years. By contrast, average 5-year expectations of all groups edged up from 5.7% to 5.9%, and ranged between 5.5% for analysts and 6.3% for business respondents. Median inflation expectations of market analysts improved over the near term. According to the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in July, expected inflation declined by 0.2 percentage points to 5.5% in 2017 and to 5.3% in 2018, compared with the May survey. However, the longer term trend is reversed with an expectation of 5.5% in 2019. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds have also declined slightly since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.3%. The global growth backdrop remains positive, with sustained upswings evident in most regions. This is despite continued uncertainty regarding economic policy reforms in    the US. Nevertheless, growth rates and potential output estimates are still generally lower than those in the pre-crisis period. While there are lingering concerns about financial stability risks from the shadow banking sector in China, the recent strong performance of the economy has contributed to the favourable environment for emerging markets. Underlying global inflation trends remain benign, with inflation below target in most of the advanced economies, notwithstanding the positive growth prognosis and tightening labour markets. An exception is the UK where inflation has accelerated in the wake of the Brexit-induced depreciation of sterling. The subdued global inflation outlook is reinforced by generally slow wage and productivity growth in developed economies. Despite the absence of inflationary pressures, central banks in a number of advanced economies have signalled intentions to move from highly accommodative monetary policy stances. These countries include the US, the UK, the euro area and Canada. This process is unlikely to be smooth or perfectly synchronised and could generate bouts of uncertainty. In the US, expectations of further near-term rate increases by the Fed have been scaled down following a succession of downside inflation surprises. The gradual nature of the planned balance sheet contraction by the Fed has also been well communicated and appears to be largely priced in by the markets. While changing expectations regarding ECB and US monetary policy in particular have impacted on a number of emerging market currencies and bond yields, the reaction has been relatively muted, and a repeat of the 2013 so-called taper tantrum episode is not expected. Those economies that were most sensitive to that episode have much improved macroeconomic balances, and their currencies are less vulnerable to    possible spill-over effects from gradual monetary tightening in the advanced economies. The rand has also been affected by these changing expectations, as well as by domestic political developments, including concerns about a proposal to change the SARB<d5>s monetary policy mandate. While the rand is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, it has been relatively volatile, having fluctuated in a range between R12.60 and R13.60 against the US dollar. The rand<d5>s relative resilience had been underpinned by the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets, as well as by sustained trade surpluses. The current account deficit is still expected to widen over the forecast period, but the degree of widening has been revised down. The rand remains vulnerable to increased global risk aversion, domestic political shocks, and to the possibility of further ratings downgrades. The domestic growth outlook remains a concern, following the surprise broad-based GDP growth contraction during the first quarter of this year. With the exception of the primary sector, all sectors recorded negative growth. While positive growth is expected in the second quarter, the Bank<d5>s annual growth forecasts have been revised down further. The forecast for 2017 has been adjusted down from 1.0% to 0.5%, and the forecast for 2018 is down from 1.5% to 1.2%. Growth of 1.5% is expected in 2019, compared with 1.7% previously. As a result of these trends, the output gap has widened somewhat despite a further downward revision to potential output growth by 0.3 percentage points for each year, to 1.1% in 2017 and rising to 1.3% in 2019. The weak outlook is consistent with the decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to levels last seen during the    recession following the global financial crisis. The SARB<d5>s composite leading business cycle indicator has also moderated somewhat since January. Monthly data for both the mining and manufacturing sectors in April and May suggest that, in the absence of a sharp contraction in June, these sectors are likely to contribute positively to growth in the second quarter, along with the continued rebound in the agricultural sector. The recovery is nevertheless expected to be modest, particularly in the light of a sharp fall in the ABSA Purchasing Mangers<d5> Index in June, which returned to below the neutral level of 50 index points. The construction sector also remains under pressure following the marked fall in building plans passed in the first quarter of this year, with the negative trend continuing into April. The continued poor performance of gross fixed capital formation contributes to the weak state of the economy. Although private sector investment recorded positive growth after five consecutive quarters of contraction, at a growth rate of 1.2% it remains very subdued. Given the extremely low level of business confidence, a near- term improvement is unlikely. Policy uncertainty, a recent example being in the mining sector, is likely to constrain investment. As a consequence, employment growth has been minimal, and the prospects are unfavourable. Given the need for fiscal consolidation, a continued decline in government<d5>s contribution to employment creation is expected. The official unemployment rate increased to 27.7% in the first quarter of this year. Consumption expenditure by households contracted in the first quarter of this year, amid a further deterioration in consumer confidence. Although the monthly retail sales data suggest a more positive outcome for the second quarter, this improvement is likely to be offset in part by a decrease in new vehicle sales in the quarter. The outlook    for consumption expenditure is expected to remain weak, amid employment uncertainty and higher tax burdens. These consumption trends are mirrored in the continued moderation in credit extension to households. Growth in mortgage advances and instalment sales credit finance remained subdued, reflective of the difficult conditions in the housing and vehicle markets. General loans to households increased moderately in May, but off a low base. Credit extension to the corporate sector, by contrast, remains relatively buoyant, but on a downward trend. Wage trends have been an important contributor to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. There are, however, indications of some moderation in average salaries, and related unit labour costs, which are expected to remain below the 6% level over the forecast period. The outcome of a number of multi-year wage agreements that are due for renewal in 2017 will be closely watched as they could pose a risk to the inflation trajectory. The persistent global oil supply glut, along with increased shale gas production in the US, have undermined efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices through output restrictions. Since the beginning of June, Brent crude oil prices have traded at levels below US 50 per barrel, and the Bank<d5>s oil price assumptions have been revised down over the forecast period. These recent oil price trends, along with the stronger exchange rate, contributed to a 69 cent per litre reduction in the petrol price in July. Following a weakening of the rand and a partial recovery in crude oil prices, a moderate petrol price increase is expected in August.    The inflation outlook has improved significantly since the previous meeting of the MPC and has been fairly broad-based. The lower core inflation outlook is indicative of weaker underlying inflation pressures, at a time when the impact of exogenous shocks on headline inflation has been dissipating. These shocks include drought-induced food price inflation and to a lesser extent international oil price increases earlier this year that have since been reversed. A number of risks to the inflation outlook persist and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be broadly balanced. Although the rand has been relatively resilient, it remains vulnerable to heightened political uncertainty, global monetary policy developments and possible further credit ratings downgrades. On the positive side, it is supported by a sustained narrowing of the current account deficit and positive investor sentiment towards emerging markets. A further upside risk relates to the possible supply side shock of a large electricity tariff increase from July next year. Eskom has approached Nersa for an increase of around 20%, but the current forecast assumes an increase of 8%. This assumption will be adjusted in line with any new determinations made by Nersa. The MPC also remains concerned that inflation expectations remain sticky at the upper end of the target range. To the extent that these expectations are formed adaptively, they should adjust downwards if the lower inflation trajectory is sustained. The MPC would prefer expectations to be anchored closer to the mid-point of the target range. Underlying demand in the economy is extremely weak and the MPC is concerned about the deterioration in the growth outlook over the forecast period. This decline is broad-based. It is unclear where the drivers of accelerated growth will come from in the absence of credible structural policy initiatives that will reduce uncertainty and increase business and consumer confidence. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside.    Given the improved inflation outlook and the deteriorated growth outlook, the MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points with effect from 21 July 2017, to 6.75% per annum. Four members preferred a reduction, while two members preferred an unchanged stance. As we have emphasised on numerous occasions, the MPC does not view monetary policy as the solution to the structural growth constraints in the economy. Nor does it believe that a reduction in interest rates will provide a significant stimulus to growth in the current environment of low confidence and political uncertainty. It will however provide some relief at the margin. In this highly uncertain environment, future policy decisions will be dependent on data outcomes and our assessment of the balance of risks. We remain vigilant and would not hesitate to reverse this decision should the inflation outlook and risks deteriorate.

                                                                          | Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  The South African economy recorded positive growth during the second quarter of 2017 following two consecutive quarters of contraction. Growth prospects, however remain subdued as domestic fixed investment contracted further amid low business confidence. The inflation forecast has increased marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with increased uncertainty regarding a number of the main drivers. The global economy is on a recovery path. Inflation has moderated in the emerging economies and remains benign in most advanced economies. The FOMC statement yesterday confirmed the gradual pace of reduction of its balance sheet and normalisation of its policy rate. Along with continued accommodative policies by the ECB, this is expected to contribute to the continuation of favourable prospects for capital flows to emerging economies.    The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 4.8% in August, up from 4.6% previously, marginally below the Bank<d5>s short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation surprised on the downside, moderating from 6.8% to 5.7%. Meat prices continued to accelerate in August, having measured 15.0%, but the lower cereal prices contributed to the slowing momentum. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.7% in July and 4.6% in August in line with the short-term forecast. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods declined from 4.0% in June to 3.6% in July. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 3.3% in July, but the divergent trend of manufactured meat prices continued with an increase of 17.8%. This trend was also evident in agricultural prices, where the subcategory of <d2>live animals<d3> increased by 31.7%, while <d2>products of crops and horticulture<d3> declined by 26.9%. The Bank<d5>s forecast for headline CPI inflation is unchanged at an annual average of 5.3% in 2017, and revised up by 0.1 percentage point to 5.0% and 5.3% in 2018 and 2019. A lower turning point of 4.6% is still expected in the first quarter of 2018. The same pattern is observed in the forecast for core inflation which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, but adjusted up to 4.9% and 5.0% for the next two years. These forecasts do not incorporate the most recent inflation outcome. The main drivers of these changes are a lower repurchase rate, a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, a slightly narrower output gap and a marginal adjustment to the food price forecast as meat prices continue to surprise on the upside. Food price    inflation is forecast to reach a low turning point of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2018, and to average 7.3% in 2017, and 5.2% and 5.6% in 2018 and 2019. There may be some downside risk to this forecast in light of the August food inflation outcomes. The electricity tariff assumption remains unchanged at 8.0% from July next year, but there may be some upside risk to this assumption, given Eskom<d5>s recent application to Nersa. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2017 continue to be relatively anchored at the upper end of the target range. Despite a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the average expected inflation for 2017 to 5.7%, expectations remain unchanged at 5.8% and 5.9% for the next two years. Expectations of analysts and business people moderated - although the latter remain above the target range - while those of trade unionists increased marginally. A welcome development is that average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 5.9% to 5.6%. This is the lowest level recorded since long-term expectations were first surveyed in 2011. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.2%. Global conditions remain generally favourable despite some geopolitical risks. The upswing appears to be synchronised, with increased world trade volumes. Growth in the US is forecast to remain above potential in the short to medium term, with the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes expected to have only a limited and short- lived impact on growth. The improved growth performance in the euro area also appears to be sustained and region-wide, while the Japanese economy has    experienced moderate growth in the past few quarters. By contrast, growth in the UK has slowed, following weak investment in the face of the Brexit headwinds. The outlook for emerging markets is also relatively positive amid generally improving fundamentals. Despite the improved growth outlook, global inflation pressures remain benign, particularly in the advanced economies. These trends are likely to contribute to the persistence of accommodative monetary policy stances in Japan and the euro area, where the recent appreciation of the euro is likely to dampen inflation pressures further. As expected, the US Fed yesterday announced a gradual reduction of its balance sheet. The process had been communicated previously and was largely priced in by the financial markets. The pace of policy rate normalisation is also expected to remain measured, as inflation continues to surprise on the downside, despite tightening labour market conditions. The stance of US fiscal policy is a source of uncertainty. Although tax reductions could lead to a faster pace of monetary tightening, the prospect of significant tax reforms has receded over time. The rand exchange rate traded in a range of between R13.54 and R12.74 since the previous meeting of the MPC, driven in part by movements in the major currencies. Over this period, the rand depreciated by 2.8% against the US dollar, by 6.2% against the euro, and by 4.5% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand remains sensitive to political developments, weak economic growth prospects and the risk of further sovereign ratings downgrades. However, it has been supported by persistent trade account surpluses and associated narrowing of the current account deficit.    The rand has also been supported by the relatively accommodative global monetary policy settings. These have contributed to sustained demand for high-yielding emerging market bonds. Net purchases by non-residents of South African government bonds have amounted to R(63) billion year to date. The domestic yield curve relative to other peer emerging market economies remains attractive to non-residents despite a decline in the curve across all maturities. However, longer-term bond yields and the rand remain vulnerable to a large non-resident sell-off in the event of further credit ratings downgrades resulting in South Africa falling out of the global bond indices. The domestic economic growth outlook remains constrained despite the higher-than- expected growth outcome of 2.5% in the second quarter of this year. This broad-based improvement, while welcome, is not expected to have a significant impact on the annual growth outcome. The Bank<d5>s forecast for GDP growth for 2017 has been revised up marginally from 0.5% to 0.6%, while the forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have remained unchanged at 1.2% and 1.5%. This outlook is consistent with the Bank<d5>s leading business cycle indicator which has been weakening since the beginning of the year, indicative of muted growth prospects. Business confidence also remains at very low levels, despite the slight improvement in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index during the third quarter. All the major sectors, apart from construction, recorded positive growth in the second quarter, with a particularly strong performance in the agricultural sector. The recovery in the manufacturing sector followed three successive quarterly contractions, while the tertiary sector reversed its one quarter contraction. The limited monthly data for the third quarter present a mixed picture at this stage. Mining sector output contracted in    July while manufacturing recorded positive growth. However, the Absa PMI has averaged 43.5 index points in the first two months of the quarter, suggesting continued headwinds for the sector. The underlying weakness in the economy is evident in the 2.6% contraction in gross fixed capital formation during the second quarter. Of particular concern is the 6.9% decline in private sector fixed investment, reflecting the low levels of business confidence. This subdued outlook is expected to persist against a backdrop of continued political and policy uncertainty. These investment trends do not bode well for employment creation in the economy. Total employment declined in the second quarter of 2017 and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 27.7%. The public sector, previously the main source of employment growth in the economy, is likely to continue to shed jobs as fiscal constraints intensify. Consumption expenditure by households rebounded strongly in the second quarter following the sizeable contraction in the previous quarter. Spending on all three major goods components recovered, but expenditure on services contracted. Despite the improved outcome, the outlook for consumption expenditure growth remains subdued, although positive, amid very low levels of consumer confidence. Month-on-month retail trade sales decreased in July, but motor vehicle sales remained relatively strong in July and August. The Bank expects household consumption growth to be in the region of 1% for this year.    The underlying drivers of household consumption expenditure remains unchanged. Lower inflation, lower interest rates and higher real income growth are expected to provide some support for consumption. Offsetting effects include depressed consumer confidence, weak employment growth, the absence of significant wealth effects, and the prospect of further tax increases in the wake of fiscal revenue shortfalls. In addition, growth in credit extension to the private sector has declined steadily over the past few months, as corporate demand for mortgage finance and general loans in particular moderated. Growth in credit extension to households remains weak and negative in real terms. These trends are also reflected in continued household deleveraging, with household debt to disposable income declining further to 72.6% in the second quarter, its lowest level since the beginning of 2006. International oil prices have increased by about US 5 per barrel since the previous meeting, with Brent crude oil currently trading at around US 55 per barrel. Nevertheless, the MPC does not expect a further sustained acceleration in prices as the flexibility of US shale oil production is expected to provide a ceiling to prices. The previous oil price assumptions therefore remain unchanged. The domestic price of 95 octane petrol has increased by a cumulative 86 cents per litre since August, mainly due to higher international product prices. A further moderate increase is expected in October.    The MPC expects inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period, closer to the mid-point than was the case early in the year. Core inflation has remained relatively stable, indicative of the absence of significant demand pressures. However, a number of risks to the inflation outlook have increased and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be somewhat on the upside. The rand remains a key upside risk to the inflation outlook. Furthermore, some of the event risks, particularly those of a political nature, are now more imminent but with no greater degree of clarity regarding the outcome. The prospect of a further ratings downgrade persists, particularly given the increased fiscal challenges and political uncertainty. The narrower current account deficit and the global environment remain supportive of the rand. However, should inflation and/or growth surprise on the upside in Europe and in the US in particular, we could see a faster pace of monetary tightening, which could impact on capital flows and the rand exchange rate. At this stage, the markets appear to be pricing a high probability of an increase in the Federal funds rate in December, and three further increases next year. A further upside risk relates to the possibility of a large electricity tariff increase than is currently assumed in our forecast from July next year. A tariff increase of 20% could raise the headline inflation forecast by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points, and the MPC will continue to assess the possible second round effects of these increases. The MPC remains concerned that inflation expectations of business people and trade unions remains above or close to 6% for the next two years even though our own forecast and those of most analysts expect inflation to be much closer to 5%. Lower inflation expectations among key price setters is an important element in reducing inflation in the future, thus enabling lower nominal interest rates. Until August, food price inflation had been moderating at a slower pace than expected, mainly due to the continued acceleration in meat prices. However, the August year- on-year outcome surprised significantly on the downside. Should this lower trajectory continue, there could be a downside risk to the food price forecast, and to the overall inflation outlook, particularly in the short term. Although household consumption expenditure rebounded strongly in the second quarter, the MPC does not view this as indicative of the longer-term trend of expenditure, which is expected to remain constrained. The second quarter growth outcome, while positive, does not change our growth forecast significantly, and the outlook remains weak. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside. In light of these developments and the deteriorating assessment of the balance of the risks, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. Three members preferred an unchanged stance and three members preferred a 25 basis point reduction. Ultimately the committee decided to keep the rate unchanged. Given the heightened uncertainties in the economy, the MPC felt it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage, and reassess the data and the balance of risks at the next meeting.

inflation outlook have increased, mainly due to higher international oil prices and a weaker rand exchange rate. Despite a deterioration in the forecast, inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period. Domestic event risks, including rating agency reviews and the economic policy implications of the ANC electoral conference, are likely to dominate rand movements over the coming weeks. The domestic growth outlook remains weak, continuing its deviation from the generally more favourable global pattern. Stronger world growth has contributed to a further increase in international oil prices, which could, in turn, provide a boost to global inflation. This may increase the pace of monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies, with possible implications for capital flows to emerging markets.    The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4.8% in October, down from 5.1% previously, marginally below the Bank<d5>s short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation continued to moderate, measuring 5.3% in October, down from 5.5% in September, but meat price inflation remained elevated at 15.5%. The Bank<d5>s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.5% in October compared with 4.6% previously. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased in August and September, to 4.2% and 5.2% respectively, having recorded a low of 3.6% in July. The higher trend was driven to a large extent by higher international oil prices and a weaker exchange rate. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 1.3% in September, but manufactured meat price inflation remained elevated at 16.5%. At the agricultural level, prices of live animals increased by 26.7%, suggesting that it may take some time for meat price inflation to normalise. The inflation forecast generated by the Bank<d5>s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows a deterioration since September. The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 5.3%, but has been revised upward for 2018 and 2019 to 5.2% and 5.5%, from 5.1% and 5.4% previously. The lower turning point, which is expected in the first quarter of 2018, increased from 4.5% to 4.7%. The main upside drivers of these changes are a weaker exchange rate path in 2018 in particular, a higher international oil price, and higher average wage growth. These pressures are offset to some extent by a more favourable food price forecast in 2018 in particular. Following a number of downside surprises, food price inflation is now expected to reach a low turning point of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared    with 4.7% previously. Average increases of 4.5% and 5.9% are now expected in 2018 and 2019, compared with previous forecasts of 5.3% and 5.9%. Furthermore, the endogenously determined path of the repo rate in the QPM also provides an offsetting effect. This path implies three interest rate increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2019, compared with one increase previously. As we elaborate later, this does not imply an unconditional commitment to this policy path. The forecast for core inflation, which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, has been adjusted up by 0.2 percentage points in both 2018 and 2019 to 5.1% and 5.3% respectively. A low turning point of 4.6% is expected in the final two quarters of 2017. The expectations of market analysts, as reflected in the Reuters econometer survey, are similar to those of the Bank<d5>s forecasts, with a slight deterioration since September. The survey conducted in November shows median forecasts of 5.2% for 2018 and 5.5% for 2019. Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation linked bond yields have increased, with the 5-year break-even inflation rates now close to the upper end of the target range. The global growth outlook remains positive despite some geopolitical risks. Confidence indices in a number of countries have reached their highest levels since the global financial crisis. Nevertheless the expectation is that world growth will remain below the levels seen before the crisis. The recovery in the advanced economies appears to be most sustained in the euro area, the US and Japan, but the outlook for the UK remains constrained by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. The extent to which this positive prognosis for some advanced economies is predicated on continued monetary accommodation is still unclear.    The outlook for emerging markets remains mixed but generally favourable, with prospects for oil producers boosted by higher oil prices. There are, however, some concerns about possible headwinds from slowing momentum in the Chinese economy. Inflation pressures are mostly benign in the advanced economies although there are some incipient near-term risks from higher international oil prices. Low wage growth is seen as a brake on core inflation pressures, despite relatively tight labour market conditions. The US Fed is expected to maintain a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening, with a further policy rate increase widely expected in December. The ECB has signalled a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases from next year, but expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time. The Bank of Japan has also maintained a highly accommodative policy stance. By contrast, the Bank of England raised its Bank rate in November in response to inflation pressures driven by the depreciation of the pound. The outlook for continued capital flows to emerging markets therefore remains relatively favourable despite the slowdown in bond flows in the past few weeks. However, the risk of a faster pace of monetary tightening in the US in particular, in the event of upside inflation or growth surprises, could reduce capital flows further. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand has depreciated by 3.6% against the US dollar, by 3.0% against the euro, and by 3.3% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand recorded a weak point of around R14.55 against the US dollar in mid- November, but has recovered somewhat since then. Factors that impacted on the rand during the period included the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the ANC electoral conference in December; concerns about a faster pace of    monetary tightening in the US; the negative reaction to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS); and speculation regarding the introduction of free higher education in South Africa. These latter two factors have raised the risk of sovereign ratings downgrades, a risk that has been hanging over the rand for some time. Downgrades of domestic currency debt to sub-investment grade could lead to South African government bonds falling out of key indices which require investment grade. Such an event could trigger significant sales of domestic bonds by non-residents. Ratings reviews are expected imminently, but the extent to which any possible downgrades may already be priced in remains uncertain. The lead-up to the ANC national elective conference and its uncertain outcome, is also likely to continue to weigh on the currency. Aside from these negative factors, the rand has been given some support by the continued surpluses on the trade account of the balance of payments. The Bank<d5>s forecasts for the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP have been revised down by about half a percentage point in all three years of the forecast period, to 2.2% in 2017, and 2.9% and 3.2% in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets remains supportive of the rand. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued but positive. Both consumer and business confidence remain low and are also likely to be affected by political developments in December. The forecast for GDP growth generated by the QPM has been revised up marginally to 0.7% for 2017, but revised down to 1.2% and 1.5% for 2018 and 2019, from 1.3% and 1.7% previously. The output gap is expected to remain negative over the forecast period. The SARB<d5>s composite    leading business cycle indicator increased further in September, consistent with a mild recovery. High frequency data suggest that the main production sectors have again contributed positively to economic growth in the third quarter. However, both the mining and manufacturing sectors experienced sharp month-on-month contractions in September. The Absa PMI has increased for three consecutive months, but at 47.8 index points remains in contractionary territory. The construction sector, which recorded negative growth in the second quarter, remains weak. Of particular concern is the sharp decline in the FNB/BER civil construction index to 15 index points in the third quarter, its lowest level since 2000. This is indicative of the poor outlook for infrastructure expenditure. Employment prospects remain unfavourable. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) conducted by Statistics South Africa, year-on-year growth of total employment measured 2.3% in the third quarter of 2017. Despite this increase, the official unemployment rate was unchanged at 27.7% for the third successive quarter. Fiscal constraints point to further job losses in the public sector. The outlook for consumption expenditure by households has improved moderately, following stronger retail trade sales in the second and third quarters. Retail trade sales recorded growth of 1.4% in the third quarter, despite month-on-month contractions in July and September. New motor vehicle sales also held up relatively well during the quarter. By contrast, wholesale trade sales contracted. The <d2>Black Friday<d3> effect is likely to boost sales in the fourth quarter as well. Nevertheless consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued over the forecast period.    Favourable drivers of real consumption expenditure include positive real income and wage growth, and some positive wealth effects from higher equity prices. Although growth in credit extension to households remains negative in real terms, it has increased in recent months. Constraining factors include higher tax burdens, low employment growth and weak consumer confidence. Wage growth continues to contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Although the year-on-year pace of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy declined in the second quarter of this year, at 6.1% it was still positive in real terms. Adjusting for labour productivity, growth in nominal unit labour costs measured 6.0% in the second quarter. Unit labour cost increases are forecast to remain above the 6% level over the forecast period. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7.6% in the first 9 months of 2017. The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) published in October revealed a rapidly deteriorating fiscal position. Significant revisions were made to the expected deficits and government debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. This deterioration was mainly a result of significantly lower tax revenues, although there was also a provision for a moderate breach of the expenditure ceiling. The less favourable path of fiscal consolidation could potentially reduce the scope for further monetary policy accommodation. International oil prices have re-emerged as an upside risk to domestic and global inflation. Having reached recent lows of around US 45 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has fluctuated in the US 60-US 65 per barrel range since late    October. This is in response to increased demand, and reportedly high compliance with the output restriction agreement brokered by OPEC. While we still expect the flexibility of the shale oil producers in the US to limit the further upside potential, oil prices are expected to remain at these elevated levels for some time. The oil price assumptions in the Bank<d5>s models have accordingly been increased moderately for both 2018 and 2019. The combination of a weaker exchange rate and higher product prices has resulted in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices by R1.00 per litre since September. The current under-recovery suggests a further increase in the region of 70 cents per litre is likely in December. The latest inflation outcomes show that headline inflation remains close to the midpoint of the target range, while core inflation has reached its lowest level in five years. However, the forecasts suggest that both measures are close to their lower turning points, and an upward trajectory is expected to begin early next year. Although inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, the risks to the outlook are assessed to be on the upside at a time when imminent key event risks contribute to an environment of particularly elevated uncertainty. These event risks affect monetary policy primarily through the exchange rate channel. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the deterioration in the fiscal stance has increased the risk of a sovereign ratings downgrade of domestic currency bonds to sub-investment grade. As noted, this could precipitate a significant sell-off of domestic government bonds by non-residents, with implications for the exchange rate and long-term bond yields. Should this occur, there is the possibility of a short-    term overreaction, and a possible partial recovery later on. The precise path and duration is highly uncertain. International oil prices have become an increasing concern. While we have adjusted our assumptions in this regard upward, a persistence of oil prices at current levels or higher pose an upside risk to the forecast. As before, a sizeable electricity tariff increase also remains a risk. We should have clarity on Eskom<d5>s tariff application by the time of the next MPC meeting. There are very few signs of domestic demand pressures, as reflected in core inflation outcomes. Although retail sales have surprised on the upside, household consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued. The economic growth outlook remains constrained, as weak confidence continues to weigh on investment expenditure. Business and consumer confidence are likely to be sensitive to the political outcomes in December. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth outlook to be on the downside. In light of the high degree of uncertainty prevailing in the economy and the balance of risks, the MPC has decided that it would be prudent to maintain the current stance of monetary policy at this stage. Accordingly, the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 6.75% per annum. The QPM generates an endogenous interest path that implies an increase in the repo rate of 75 basis points by the end of 2019. We need to stress that this does not mean an unconditional commitment to change policy rates in line with this path. The forecasts and implied path are a broad guide to policy and not necessarily prescriptive. Depending on economic conditions, the MPC may choose to diverge from the suggested path and alternative paths could be generated that are still    consistent with achieving the inflation target. Collective judgement therefore remains critical. As always, MPC members needs to weigh the risks to the forecasts and assess the trade-offs. It is also the case that the implied path can change from meeting to meeting as the data and risks change.

       "1 Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the near-term inflation outlook has deteriorated, but the longer-term outlook is more or less unchanged. The expected inflation profile has been negatively affected by higher international oil prices and a persistence in elevated food price inflation despite improved rainfall in many of the drought-stricken regions. At the same time, the rand has displayed some resilience. While some of the key risks to the rand appear to have subsided for now, they could re-emerge at any stage. Global growth prospects are mixed amid policy uncertainty, primarily in the US and the UK. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, although a modest improvement is expected over the forecast period. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,8 per cent in December, up from 6,6 per cent in November. The December outcome surprised on the upside relative to the Bank\\xd5s forecast and the market consensus expectation of 6,5 per cent. The main sources of this surprise included food prices, housing rentals, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels. Food price inflation remained elevated at 12,0 per cent in December, matching the recent high recorded in October 2016. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome has remained unchanged at 1,8 percentage points for the past 3 months. Goods price inflation measured 7,8 per cent in December, up from 7,7 per cent in November, while services price inflation increased from 5,6 per cent to 5,9 per cent. The Bank\\xd5s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,9 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 6,9 per cent in November, compared with 6,6 per cent in October. The main contributor to the November outcome was the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 3,9 percentage points. The inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to only return to within the target range during the final quarter of 2017, and to average 6,2 per cent for the year, compared with 5,8 per cent in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2018 is more or less unchanged at an average of 5,5 per cent. The peak of the forecast remains at 6,6 per cent, which was recorded in the final quarter of 2016, and this level is now expected to persist in the first quarter of 2017. This deterioration is mainly due to changed assumptions regarding international oil prices, the domestic fuel prices and the outlook for food prices, which more than offset the more favourable exchange rate assumption.By contrast, the forecast for core inflation is unchanged, averaging 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research during the fourth quarter of 2016 showed average inflation expectations for 2017 declining from 6,0 per cent in the third quarter to 5,8 per cent. The same outcome is expected for 2018, as well as for 5-year inflation expectations. Despite the slight moderation, expectations remain more or less anchored at the upper end of the target range, but with a narrower divergence between the different groups of respondents than is usually the case. The expectations of these groups ranged from 5,6 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2017, and from 5,4 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2018. The outcome may have been distorted by the marked decline of 0,6 percentage points for the trade union respondents. The median annual inflation expectations of market analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey are relatively unchanged at 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent for 2017 and 2018. Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates declined across all maturities since the previous meeting, though remain above the target range. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, despite increased optimism regarding US growth following the US presidential elections. There is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the policies of the new administration, particularly with respect to the size of the promised fiscal stimulus. While some of the initial optimism has since been tempered somewhat, US growth is expected to be relatively strong, but with some downside risks posed by a stronger dollar. Uncertainty also persists regarding the prospects for the UK economy, as the terms of the disengagement from the EU are unlikely to be resolved for some time. The steady but slow growth recovery in the Eurozone is expected to continue, but upcoming elections in a number of countries could pose risks to the outlook, alongside ongoing concerns about the prospects for the Italian economy. The outlook for emerging markets is also unclear, given conflicting developments. Commodity prices, especially industrial commodities, have risen in recent months, but protectionist threats from the US, if carried through, could undermine world trade and have an adverse effect on emerging markets in particular. These countries are also highly dependent on Chinese growth, which is expected to remain above the 6 per cent level. However, given the credit-driven nature of recent Chinese growth, there are fears of an unsustainable credit bubble which could expose financial sector vulnerabilities, and undermine the growth outlook. There are tentative signs of global inflation edging up, as fears of deflation recede amid higher energy and food prices. As expected, the US Fed tightened monetary policy in December, and signalled further increases to come. However, the pace of increase is still expected to be relatively moderate amid a highly uncertain economic policy environment. Both the ECB and the Bank of Japan have maintained their highly accommodative policy stances. This divergence between the advanced economies is likely to persist for some time. The rand has displayed a degree of resilience since the previous meeting of the MPC, having traded in a relatively narrow range of between R14,22 and R13,46 against the US dollar. Since the previous meeting, the rand has appreciated by 5,6 per cent against the US dollar and by 4,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand was positively impacted by the decisions of the ratings agencies not to downgrade the sovereign foreign credit rating to sub-investment grade, although this remains a risk in the coming months. The limited response of the rand exchange rate to the increase in the US policy rate in mid-December suggests that the move had been largely priced in. A gradual pace of tightening is expected in the US, with the rand vulnerable to any upside surprises in this respect. The rand has been positively affected by the improvement in the terms of trade, following the recent modest increase in commodity prices. Although the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow over the forecast period, it remains relatively wide. In line with the recent improved capital flows to emerging economy bond markets, non-residents have been net buyers of South African bonds since the beginning of the year, while equity net sales have continued. This follows persistent net sales of both bonds and equities during the last three months of 2016. The domestic growth outlook remains weak and more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The Bank expects growth to have averaged 0,4 per cent in 2016, although recent monthly data for the fourth quarter suggest that there may be a downside risk to this forecast. The forecast for 2017 has been revised down marginally to 1,1 per cent (from 1,2 per cent), and remains unchanged at 1,6 per cent for 2018. This improved outlook relative to 2016 is consistent with the recent upward trend in the composite leading indicator of the Bank. By contrast, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined again in the fourth quarter, following a recovery in the previous quarter. Much of this decline was driven by the new vehicle sector. The recent monthly data paint a bleak picture for the fourth quarter of 2016. Mining production, which had improved in the second and third quarters, contracted in both October and November. However, improved commodity prices are expected to help the sector in the coming months. The manufacturing sector recorded low but positive growth in November, following a month-to-month decline in October. The Barclays Purchasing Managers\\xd5 Index (PMI) declined further in December, and recorded its fifth consecutive month below the neutral 50 level. The low level of business confidence is reflected in the continued, but slower, contraction in real gross fixed capital formation. Gross fixed investment has contracted for four consecutive quarters, and has been particularly marked in the private sector. This has contributed to the persistent labour market weakness, with formal non-agricultural employment (excluding temporary election-related employment) remaining unchanged in the year to the third quarter of 2016. The official unemployment rate increased to 27,1 per cent, its highest level since the inception of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey in 2008. Wage growth appears to be responding to the weak labour market environment. Year-on-year nominal wage growth per worker moderated for a fifth consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2016, down to 5,8 per cent. Following a small decline in labour productivity growth, nominal unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sector increased to 5,7 per cent. The slower nominal wage growth per worker is consistent with the lower wage settlement rates reported by Andrew Levy Employment Publications. Household consumption expenditure data paint a mixed picture. Growth in household consumption expenditure accelerated to 2,6 per cent in the third quarter despite a further contraction in durable goods consumption. Real retail trade sales declined in October, but increased markedly in November on a month-to-month basis. By contrast wholesale trade sales contracted in both months. Domestic new vehicle sales remained subdued following further declines in the final quarter of last year. Notwithstanding some improvement, consumers remain under pressure and consumer confidence remains low, as indicated in the sharp contraction in the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index in the fourth quarter. Households remain highly indebted despite a further moderation in the debt ratio, and the subdued housing and equity markets have contributed to an absence of strong wealth effects. Slower wage growth along with stagnant employment growth and expected tax increases in the forthcoming budget are also likely to dampen consumption expenditure. A further constraint to consumption expenditure growth has been the weak credit extension to the private sector, which, at 4,5 per cent in November, was the lowest year-on-year growth since late 2010. While growth in credit extension to the household sector was particularly subdued, that to the corporate sector also moderated in the second half of 2016. The strongest decline was seen in mortgage credit extension for commercial property. Food price inflation is expected to decline following good rainfall in parts of the country. Spot prices for both maize and wheat have declined significantly, and a markedly higher maize crop is expected this year. However, the impact on prices at the consumer level are yet to be felt, with meat prices likely to lag other food price categories as farmers restock their herds. Although the Bank\\xd5s inflation forecast assumes that food price inflation has more or less peaked, the pace of moderation is expected to be slower than in the previous forecast. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7,0 per cent during 2017, compared with 6,5 per cent previously. Food price disinflation is expected to be constrained or delayed by higher fuel costs and a rising trend in global food prices. Brent crude oil prices increased by over 20 per cent to almost US 60 per barrel in response to the OPEC-brokered agreement to restrict production. Prices have since moderated to current levels of around US 55 per barrel. The sustainability of this agreement and its longer-term impact on prices is uncertain, given the possibility of offsetting developments. A number of oil producers were exempt from the agreement; there are incentives and scope for cartel members to exceed their quotas; and US shale producers have already increased production in response to higher prices. These factors are likely to constrain oil price increases. While the Bank\\xd5s oil price assumption has been revised up, the trajectory is relatively flat. Despite the stronger rand exchange rate, the domestic price of 93 octane petrol increased by 50 cents per litre in January, and a further increase can be expected in February. The MPC has noted the marked deterioration in the inflation forecast since the previous meeting, as well as the extension of the expected breach of the upper level of the target range by a further two quarters. Inflation is now expected to return to within the target range in the final quarter of 2017. While this is a cause for concern, the main drivers of this deterioration are supply side shocks, in particular oil and food prices. The increase in the international oil price is not expected to be a start of a new oil price spiral. Various supply side factors are expected to constrain oil prices going forward in the absence of any major global political risks that would threaten production. While the food price forecast has been adversely affected by higher input costs, a steady decline in food price inflation is still expected. The more favourable rand exchange rate has been an important factor in offsetting some of the negative impacts of these developments. Despite a turbulent second half of 2016, both domestically and globally, the rand has been relatively resilient. Furthermore, the current level of the rand is stronger than that implicit in the forecast, and pass-through to inflation continues to be relatively muted. Nevertheless it remains vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks. As always, the approach of the Committee is to look through the first-round effects of exogenous shocks, but remain focused on the possible emergence of second-round effects which could require a policy response. At this stage, the longer-term trajectory over the relevant policy horizon is unchanged, as is the forecast for core inflation. In particular, the MPC will take note of possible changes in the longer-term inflation expectations, which had shown tentative signs of moderation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside. The domestic growth outlook has remained largely unchanged despite a possible weaker outcome in the fourth quarter of 2016. While some improvement is anticipated over the forecast period, growth is expected to remain below potential. The risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be broadly balanced. Growth prospects remain dependent on uncertain but tentatively improving global conditions, and their impact on commodity prices. Domestically, some improvement in agricultural production can be expected. However, a significant improvement in growth prospects requires the implementation of structural reforms which could contribute to increased business and consumer confidence. In light of these developments and the assessment of the balance of risks, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains focused on the medium- to longer-term inflation outlook, but the deterioration of the shorter-term outlook requires increased vigilance. Furthermore, the MPC remains concerned that the longer-term inflation trajectory continues to be uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The Committee retains the view that we may be near the end of the hiking cycle. However, should second- round effects emerge that undermine the longer-term inflation outlook, there may be a reassessment of this view. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR\n",
       "2 Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the inflation outlook has improved. This was mainly due to the further appreciation of the rand exchange rate following the benign market reaction to the US Fed monetary policy tightening, as well as the significant narrowing of the domestic current account deficit. A more positive growth outlook in the advanced economies has also contributed to a more favourable environment for emerging markets generally. However, the recent heightened domestic political uncertainty has reversed some of these exchange rate gains, and the risk of further rand weakening overshadows the inflation outlook. Domestic growth prospects remain constrained, although the low point of the cycle is probably behind us. Demand pressures are expected to remain weak amid low business and consumer confidence. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.3% in February, from 6.6% in January, in line with the market consensus expectation. Food price inflation, which measured 10.0%, moderated for the second consecutive month following its recent peak of 12.0% in December. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.9 percentage points in January to 1.7 percentage points in February. The Bank\\xd5s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5.2%, down from 5.5%. This follows a recent peak of 5.9% in December 2016. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5.6% in February compared with 5.9% in January. The category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerated for the sixth consecutive month to 8.4%, following its recent peak of 13.4% in August last year. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved, reversing most of the deterioration seen at the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter previously, and to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. CPI inflation is expected to average 5.9% for the year, compared with 6.2% in the previous forecast, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated from an average of 5.5% to 5.4%. The forecast period has been extended to 2019, with an expected average of 5.5% for the year. This improvement is mainly due to a more appreciated exchange rate assumption. Despite the recent depreciation, the current level of the rand is still consistent with the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. Although the international oil price  assumption remains unchanged, the exchange rate is expected to lead to lower petrol price inflation, and is reflected in a downward revision to the assumption for administered prices. This favourable trend is partially offset by a slower pace of disinflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages, driven by an expected acceleration in poultry prices in particular. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7.4% and 5.2% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.0% and 5.0% previously. The forecast for core inflation is marginally lower than before at an average of 5.4% in 2017, and unchanged at 5.2% in 2018. An average core inflation of 5.3% is expected in 2019. Inflation expectations as measured by the Bureau for Economic Research show a deterioration over the near-term in particular. The average expectation for 2017 has increased from 5.8% to 6.2%, with the largest upward revisions coming from businesses and labour respondents. The average expectation for 2018 increased marginally from 5.8% to 5.9%, while the expected inflation for 2019 is 6.0%. By contrast, average inflation expectations over five years declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.7%. Median inflation expectations of economic analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in March, are more or less unchanged since January. Inflation is expected to average 5.8% in 2017, and 5.5% and 5.4% in the coming two years, roughly in line with the Bank\\xd5s forecast. Inflation expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation linked bonds) had declined since the previous meeting, but have since spiked following the recent depreciation of the rand, and remain above the 6.0% level for longer-dated maturities. The global economy shows continued signs of a broad-based improvement. The growth outlook in the US remains favourable with business confidence indices at high levels. However, there is growing uncertainty about the timing and size of the expected fiscal stimulus. Tax reform may take longer than anticipated following the recent failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Growth prospects in Japan and Europe are also more promising, with the PMI reaching a six-year high in the euro area, led by the services sectors in France and Germany. The extent to which the sustainability of this improvement is dependent on the highly accommodative monetary policy stance is still unclear. The outlook for emerging markets is also more positive, in part driven by the recovery in the advanced economies, and stronger demand in China. Firmer commodity prices have also helped, but an oversupply of some commodities could limit these gains. Global inflation provides a mixed picture with the recent decline in international oil prices threatening to reverse the broad-based increases in headline inflation in the advanced economies. Some inflation normalisation is evident in the US and the euro area, but Japan is showing less momentum in price and wage growth. Inflation in the UK is expected to overshoot the target for some time, as the economy adjusts to a weaker currency. Similarly, inflation experiences in a number of emerging economies have reflected divergent currency movements. The US Fed raised its policy rate in March in response to the stronger inflation trend and improved growth outlook. While this action was widely expected, the gradual nature of the expected interest rate cycle implicit in the forward guidance surprised the markets. Policy rates are expected to remain at low levels for some time in most of the advanced economies until more favourable inflation and growth dynamics are more firmly entrenched. For the past few months the rand exchange rate had been relatively resilient, along with a number of other emerging market currencies. While most measures of emerging market risk have narrowed over recent months, those for South Africa have widened again over the past few days. The rand has depreciated significantly in response to increased domestic political uncertainty and the exchange rate has re- emerged as an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by 3.9% against the US dollar, by 4.0% against the euro and by 3.4% on a trade-weighted basis. The prospect of US monetary policy tightening had been seen as a risk to the exchange rate. However, the rand and other peer currencies strengthened in response to the Fed actions in March, indicative of revised market expectations of a more moderate tightening cycle than that priced in. The rand has also been underpinned by favourable terms of trade trends. Furthermore, the improving trend of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments has reduced the perceived vulnerability of the rand to possible capital flow reversals. However, while significant adjustment of the current account has occurred, the deficit is not expected to remain at the level seen in the fourth quarter of last year. The domestic growth outlook remains weak following the negative growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2016 annual GDP growth of 0.3% is likely to have been the low point of the growth cycle, and a mild recovery is expected over the forecast period. The Bank\\xd5s forecast for GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points in both 2017 and 2018, to 1.2% and 1.7%, with growth of 2.0% forecast for 2019. While growth is still expected to be below estimated potential output growth of around 1.4% in the near term, the output gap is expected to narrow to some extent in the later part of the forecast period. The more favourable growth outlook is consistent with the Bank\\xd5s leading indicator of economic activity which has increased for six consecutive months. The main drivers of growth are expected to be net exports and positive, albeit weak, household consumption expenditure growth. Some impetus is expected to come from fixed capital formation in the outer period of the forecast. At a sectoral level, the agricultural sector is expected to return to positive growth following good rains in a number of regions and improved maize crop estimates. A modest recovery in the manufacturing sector is expected following two consecutive months of the Absa PMI being above the neutral 50 point level, while the mining sector is forecast to respond to more favourable commodity prices. Low growth in gross fixed capital formation remains a downside risk to growth in the short term. In 2016 gross fixed capital formation contracted for the first time since 2010, with the ratio of fixed capital formation to GDP declining from 20.4% in 2015 to 19.6% in 2016. Private sector investment remains particularly weak, having contracted for five successive quarters. This is reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which increased marginally in the first quarter of 2017, but at 40 index points remains well below the neutral level of 50. The BER Manufacturing survey shows a sharp decline in expected capital investment over the next 12 months, with the political climate cited as the main reason.  The constrained growth outlook does not bode well for employment creation in the economy. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, employment increased by 0.3% while the number of unemployed grew by 11.3%. This resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate by 2.0 percentage points to 26.5%. Consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 0.8% in 2016 remains subdued amid low consumer confidence. While growth of 2.2% was recorded in both of the final two quarters of the 2016, negative retail and wholesale trade sales growth in December and January underscore the likely persistence of this weakness. New vehicle sales continued to decline in February, although exports increased significantly. These trends are expected to persist as the impact of a higher tax burden, low employment growth and weak wealth effects take their toll on consumption expenditure. In addition, credit extension by banks to the private sector continues to grow at low rates, particularly to households amid a further decline in the household debt to disposable income ratio. Expenditure will be supported to some extent by positive but moderate real income growth. Fiscal policy as outlined in the recent budget remains committed to a steady pace of deficit reduction over the next three years. Lower tax revenues relative to budget \\xd0 partly a consequence of slower economic growth \\xd0 have resulted in a shortfall to be filled by a combination of lower expenditure growth, increased fuel levies and other excise duties, and a number of tax changes. These include limited compensation for fiscal drag and a higher marginal tax bracket for high-income earners. The tax   increases are expected to act as a drag on household consumption expenditure, particularly for middle and upper income earners. International oil prices have declined following increased oil inventories and weak compliance with the OPEC-brokered deal to restrict output, and an increase in shale gas production in the US. Although Brent crude oil prices increased by about 10% in the wake of this agreement, these gains have been largely reversed, with oil prices back in the region of US 50 per barrel for the past three weeks. The impact on the domestic petrol price will be evident in April when a reduction is expected, despite the 39 cent increase in the Road Accident Fund and fuel levies provided for in the February budget. Since the previous MPC meeting the inflation outlook has improved. However, the risk to the inflation forecast has been affected by the reaction of the of the exchange rate to the current elevated levels of political uncertainty. At current levels of around R13.00 against the US dollar, the exchange rate is still moderately stronger than the level implied in the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. However, the rand is likely to react further to unfolding developments until a greater degree of certainty and confidence is restored. The possibility of significant overshooting of the exchange rate in the short run also cannot be ruled out. As always, the MPC will attempt to \\xd2look through\\xd3 short term fluctuations and focus on longer term trends in its policy settings.  The MPC remains concerned about the elevated level of inflation expectations. While the near-term reversal was not unexpected, given the deterioration of the short-term inflation outlook in January, the longer term expectations remain anchored uncomfortably at the upper end of the target range. Not all the inflation risk factors are on the upside. The deterioration in the forecast at the previous meeting was due in part to a higher international oil price assumption. This assumption has not been adjusted to reflect the recent market developments. There is a downside risk to this assumption, given the possibility of these more moderate trends persisting. A further downside risk comes from electricity price increases, which could turn out to be lower than the 8.0% currently in the forecast from mid-2017. The final price determination by the energy regulator is yet to be announced. Overall, the MPC assesses the risk to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside, mainly due to the high degree of exchange rate uncertainty. The MPC sees no evidence of significant demand pressures impacting on inflation. The growth outlook remains disappointing, and the MPC is concerned that increased political uncertainty could impact negatively on private sector investment and household consumption expenditure, and further undermine employment growth. The risks to the growth outlook are therefore assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance and one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9     The MPC is of the view that we may have reached the end of the tightening cycle. However the Committee would like to see a more sustained improvement in the inflation outlook before reducing rates. This assessment may however change if the inflation outlook and the risks to the outlook deteriorate.

       "3 Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Headline inflation has now returned to within the target range as expected, with outcomes in March and April surprising on the downside. While the inflation outlook has improved over the near term, the longer-term forecast trajectory is unchanged and uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The rand exchange rate and domestic bond yields benefited from increased global capital inflows to emerging markets which largely offset the impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade. With further ratings decisions imminent, risks remain for a further depreciation against the backdrop of continued global and domestic political uncertainty. 1      Domestic economic growth prospects have deteriorated, as the impact of the ratings downgrade is expected to weigh on domestic investment and consumer sentiment over the forecast period. The output gap is estimated to have widened, and consumer demand has weakened. However, the trajectory of the growth forecast is still positive, and the growth rate for this year is expected to exceed that recorded in 2016. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.1% and 5.3% in March and April. Food price inflation was the main contributor to the downside surprise in April when it measured 6.6%. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.5 percentage points in March to 1.1 percentage points. The Bank\\xd5s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8%, down from 4.9%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods also surprised on the downside at 4.6% in April compared with 5.2% in March. The further moderation in food prices was also reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the sixth consecutive month to 6.4%. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved over the near term, but is unchanged in the outer quarters. In line with the previous forecast, headline consumer price inflation is expected to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. Inflation is expected to average 5.7% this year compared with 5.9% previously, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated by 0.1 percentage point to 5.3%. The forecast average for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%.  The improvement is driven by downward revisions to international oil price and domestic electricity tariff assumptions. In the latter case, a tariff increase of 4.0% with effect from July 2017 is assumed, down from 8.0%. These revisions have been offset to some extent by a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, and a slower decline in food price inflation. A continued moderation of food prices is expected over the medium term given the favourable agricultural outlook and significant upward revisions to the maize crop estimates. Food price inflation is expected to average 7.7% and 5.4% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.4% and 5.2% previously, and unchanged at 5.5% in 2019. The forecast for core inflation in 2017 is 0.4 percentage points lower at 5.0%, partly due to the lower starting point of 0.2 percentage points following the sizeable downside surprise in March. The forecast for 2018 declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%, and is unchanged at 5.3% in 2019. Market-based inflation expectations are largely unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, with the median forecasts in the latest Reuters Econometer survey similar to those of the Bank. The median expectation for 2017 declined marginally to 5.7%, and is unchanged at 5.5% and 5.4% for the next two years. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates in the bond market have also moderated since the previous meeting. Break-even inflation rates for shorter-dated maturities are below 6% but higher than this level for longer-dated maturities. The global growth outlook continues to show signs of sustained recovery amid rising world trade volumes. Nevertheless, the trend growth rate is expected to be lower than that experienced before the global financial crisis. The current recovery is characterised by downward revisions to potential output growth in numerous countries, and generally low levels of productivity and wage growth. Despite a weak first quarter, US growth is expected to average above 2.0% this year, although further policy uncertainty could undermine investor and consumer confidence. Growth rates in the euro area and Japan are expected to be sustained at around 2016 levels, supported by accommodative monetary policies. The outlook for emerging markets is also generally positive. Concerns about Chinese growth have dissipated somewhat following policy intervention, but high leverage in the financial sector remains a risk. While Russia has emerged from recession, the expected recovery in Brazil may be undermined by current political uncertainty. The outlook for commodity producers may be tempered by recent weaker commodity price trends, particularly those of iron ore and coal. Global inflation remains relatively benign although country experiences differ. Inflation is below target in most of the advanced economies, apart from the UK, and the risk of deflation is low except in Japan. Where high inflation rates are being experienced in a number of emerging markets, these are generally driven by exchange rate shocks rather than underlying global price pressures. Monetary policies are also likely to remain divergent. The US Fed is expected to maintain its moderate pace of tightening, dependent to some degree on the size and nature of possible fiscal reforms. Policy rates are expected to remain low in most other advanced economies, but a reduction in quantitative easing is possible in the near future in the euro area. In general, emerging market economies have displayed a loosening bias, particularly in those countries where previous policy tightening had resulted in improved inflation prospects. The high yield differentials of emerging markets have persisted, sustaining capital flows to these economies. At the time of the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand was trading at around R13.00 against the US dollar. It then depreciated following the domestic cabinet reshuffle and the consequent sovereign credit ratings downgrades by two ratings agencies. Having reached a weak point of almost R14.00 against the US dollar in April, the rand subsequently recovered some of these losses in line with improved sentiment towards emerging markets in general. Some of these gains were reversed by spill-over effects of recent political uncertainty in Brazil. Since the previous meeting the rand has appreciated by 0.4% against the US dollar and depreciated by 1.6% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels the rand is still more appreciated relative to rates prevailing at this time last year. Despite the recent weakening, the rand has been supported by a more favourable current account outlook, following a significant narrowing of the deficit in the final quarter of last year. A further positive trade balance was recorded in the first quarter of this year, but a moderately wider current account deficit is expected over the forecast period, due in part to a recent deterioration in the terms of trade. Non-residents remained net buyers of domestic government bonds in April and May to date, to the value of R23.2 billion, despite the recent ratings downgrades. This may change should further downgrades occur, particularly with respect to domestic currency ratings. The rand therefore remains vulnerable to this prospect, as well as to changes in global risk sentiment towards emerging markets. The domestic growth outlook has deteriorated amid weak business and consumer confidence. The Bank\\xd5s forecast for GDP growth has been revised down for the entire forecast period, by 0.2 percentage points for 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019. Annual growth rates of 1.0%, 1.5% and 1.7% for the forecast years are now expected. This downward revision is due in part to the expected impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade on domestic private sector gross fixed capital formation in particular. The downgrade is also likely to weigh on public sector investment through higher funding costs and more difficult access to funding. At the sectoral level, a strong near-term improvement is expected in the agricultural sector, and mining output has also rebounded. By contrast, the manufacturing sector outlook remains constrained, with a third consecutive quarterly contraction expected in the first quarter of this year. In line with this, the latest ABSA Purchasing Managers Index showed a sharp decline. Growth in the trade sector also appears to have moderated somewhat.  A slower but positive pace of household consumption expenditure growth is forecast for this year. Real retail and wholesale trade sales contracted in the first quarter of this year. While domestic sales of passenger motor vehicles improved, the outlook for the sector remains subdued. Factors such as low consumer confidence, higher tax burdens, the absence of significant wealth effects and stagnant employment growth have contributed to these weaker consumption trends. In addition to these factors, credit extension to the household sector in particular remains weak, and is reflected in further household deleveraging. Although credit extension to the corporate sector is still relatively robust, the downward growth trend has persisted. There may, however, be some relief to consumers from moderating inflation, while increases in real disposable income over the forecast period are also expected to provide some support to consumption, but to a lesser extent than previously. Nominal salary and wage increases have continued to show signs of moderation, but are still at levels that contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. While continued moderation of nominal unit labour costs are expected over most of the forecast period, the trajectory has been revised slightly upwards largely due to the weaker economic growth projections. International oil prices have firmed since the previous meeting, having declined to levels below US 50 per barrel at one stage. The recovery was a response to indications that the OPEC agreement to curtail output would be extended for a further six months. However, the fragility of this agreement, and the increase in shale   production in the US is expected to cap increases going forward. The international oil price assumption has been revised down by US 2 per barrel for each forecast year, but the moderate upward trend has been maintained. Domestic petrol prices increased by around 50 cents per litre in May, due to the weaker exchange rate and higher international product prices. The current over-recovery on the petrol price indicates that a reduction of around 20 cents per litre is likely in June, mainly due to international price movements. The short-term inflation outlook has improved further since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Headline inflation in April was lower than expected, largely related to the pace of food disinflation. The MPC notes, however, that there have been broad-based downside surprises in core inflation as well. The current forecast does not incorporate the most recent outcomes, and further downside surprises in the coming months could impact of the starting point of the forecast and lower the entire trajectory. However, in the absence of such revisions, the MPC remains concerned about the persistence of the longer-term forecast trend at elevated levels within the target. This gives very little headroom to absorb the impact of possible adverse shocks. The rand remains a key upside risk to the forecast. The rand has, however, been surprisingly resilient in the face of recent domestic developments. This is partly due to offsetting factors, particularly positive sentiment towards emerging markets and the improved current account balance. The current level of the exchange rate, at below R13.00 against the dollar, is slightly stronger than at the time of the last  meeting and stronger than that implicit in the starting point for the real exchange rate assumption. The outlook for the rand, and therefore the risks to the inflation outlook, will be highly sensitive to unfolding domestic political uncertainty, as well as decisions by the credit ratings agencies. The rand could weaken significantly in the event of a worst-case ratings downgrade scenario that could result in South African government bonds falling out of the global bond indices. A downside risk may come from electricity tariffs. The increases from July may be lower than the 4.0% now assumed, given the 1.8% guideline for municipalities published by Nersa. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to this assumption for next year, when a new application from Eskom is likely. Currently an 8.0% increase is assumed from July next year. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced. Domestic demand pressures remain subdued, and, given the continued negative consumer and business sentiment, the risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9     The MPC remains of the view that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate for now and that we are likely at the end of the tightening cycle. A reduction in rates would be possible should inflation continue to surprise on the downside and the forecast over the policy horizon be sustainably within the target range. However, in the current environment of high levels of uncertainty, the risks to the outlook could easily deteriorate, and derail the current favourable assessment.

       "4 Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the inflation outlook has improved. Food price inflation has moderated faster than expected, domestic demand pressures remain subdued and international oil prices have declined. Despite a degree of volatility, the rand exchange rate has been relatively resilient in the face of expected monetary policy tightening in some advanced economies, as well as domestic political risks and uncertainties. Risks to the inflation outlook still remain. At the same time, domestic growth prospects have deteriorated further following the surprise GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2017. The economy has now recorded two successive quarters of negative growth, and although a near-term improvement is expected, the outlook remains challenging. A number of sentiment indicators and data points have reached levels last seen during the 2009 recession, at the height of the global financial crisis. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5.4% and 5.1% in May and June, in line with the Bank\\xd5s short- term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation measured 6.9% in both months, with the contribution to the overall inflation outcome unchanged at 1.2 percentage points. Meat prices continued to accelerate, and at 13.0%, contributed to the downside stickiness of food price inflation. The Bank\\xd5s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8% in both months. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 4.6% in April and 4.8% in May. The further moderation in food prices was reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the seventh consecutive month to 5.8%. The divergent trends between the subcategories of \\xd2products of crops and horticulture\\xd3 and \\xd2live animals\\xd3 persisted, with year-on-year changes of -24.4% and 21.4% respectively. The Bank\\xd5s forecast for headline CPI inflation has shown a marked improvement since the previous meeting. The annual average forecast has been revised down by 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019, to 5.3%, 4.9% and 5.2%. A lower turning point of 4.6% is expected in the first quarter of 2018 (previously 5.1%), and an average of 5.2% is forecast for the final quarter of 2019. The main drivers of the improved forecast were the lower starting point; revised assumptions regarding international oil prices, domestic electricity tariffs and the real effective exchange rate; and a wider output gap. These assumptions are set out in the annexure to this statement. Food price inflation is also expected to be more subdued, due to a lower starting point and more favourable domestic crop estimates. Despite a persistent upward trend in meat price inflation, the forecast for food price inflation has been revised down from 7.7% to 7.3% for this year; and from 5.4% to 5.1% in 2018. The forecast for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%. The improvement is also evident in the core inflation outlook, with average forecasts of 4.8% for 2017 and 2018, and 4.9% for 2019. This compares with previous forecasts of 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.3% for these years. This improvement is driven in part by lower unit labour costs, in addition to the exchange rate and output gap developments. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research show a marginal improvement, with average expectations slightly below 6% in all three years. The decline was most marked among analysts, particularly over the first two survey years, and to a lesser extent among labour unionists. Both these categories of respondents expect inflation to be within the target range over the forecast period. The expectations of business respondents are largely unchanged and remain above 6% for all three years. By contrast, average 5-year expectations of all groups edged up from 5.7% to 5.9%, and ranged between 5.5% for analysts and 6.3% for business respondents. Median inflation expectations of market analysts improved over the near term. According to the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in July, expected inflation declined by 0.2 percentage points to 5.5% in 2017 and to 5.3% in 2018, compared with the May survey. However, the longer term trend is reversed with an expectation of 5.5% in 2019. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds have also declined slightly since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.3%. The global growth backdrop remains positive, with sustained upswings evident in most regions. This is despite continued uncertainty regarding economic policy reforms in    the US. Nevertheless, growth rates and potential output estimates are still generally lower than those in the pre-crisis period. While there are lingering concerns about financial stability risks from the shadow banking sector in China, the recent strong performance of the economy has contributed to the favourable environment for emerging markets. Underlying global inflation trends remain benign, with inflation below target in most of the advanced economies, notwithstanding the positive growth prognosis and tightening labour markets. An exception is the UK where inflation has accelerated in the wake of the Brexit-induced depreciation of sterling. The subdued global inflation outlook is reinforced by generally slow wage and productivity growth in developed economies. Despite the absence of inflationary pressures, central banks in a number of advanced economies have signalled intentions to move from highly accommodative monetary policy stances. These countries include the US, the UK, the euro area and Canada. This process is unlikely to be smooth or perfectly synchronised and could generate bouts of uncertainty. In the US, expectations of further near-term rate increases by the Fed have been scaled down following a succession of downside inflation surprises. The gradual nature of the planned balance sheet contraction by the Fed has also been well communicated and appears to be largely priced in by the markets. While changing expectations regarding ECB and US monetary policy in particular have impacted on a number of emerging market currencies and bond yields, the reaction has been relatively muted, and a repeat of the 2013 so-called taper tantrum episode is not expected. Those economies that were most sensitive to that episode have much improved macroeconomic balances, and their currencies are less vulnerable to    possible spill-over effects from gradual monetary tightening in the advanced economies. The rand has also been affected by these changing expectations, as well as by domestic political developments, including concerns about a proposal to change the SARB\\xd5s monetary policy mandate. While the rand is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, it has been relatively volatile, having fluctuated in a range between R12.60 and R13.60 against the US dollar. The rand\\xd5s relative resilience had been underpinned by the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets, as well as by sustained trade surpluses. The current account deficit is still expected to widen over the forecast period, but the degree of widening has been revised down. The rand remains vulnerable to increased global risk aversion, domestic political shocks, and to the possibility of further ratings downgrades. The domestic growth outlook remains a concern, following the surprise broad-based GDP growth contraction during the first quarter of this year. With the exception of the primary sector, all sectors recorded negative growth. While positive growth is expected in the second quarter, the Bank\\xd5s annual growth forecasts have been revised down further. The forecast for 2017 has been adjusted down from 1.0% to 0.5%, and the forecast for 2018 is down from 1.5% to 1.2%. Growth of 1.5% is expected in 2019, compared with 1.7% previously. As a result of these trends, the output gap has widened somewhat despite a further downward revision to potential output growth by 0.3 percentage points for each year, to 1.1% in 2017 and rising to 1.3% in 2019. The weak outlook is consistent with the decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to levels last seen during the    recession following the global financial crisis. The SARB\\xd5s composite leading business cycle indicator has also moderated somewhat since January. Monthly data for both the mining and manufacturing sectors in April and May suggest that, in the absence of a sharp contraction in June, these sectors are likely to contribute positively to growth in the second quarter, along with the continued rebound in the agricultural sector. The recovery is nevertheless expected to be modest, particularly in the light of a sharp fall in the ABSA Purchasing Mangers\\xd5 Index in June, which returned to below the neutral level of 50 index points. The construction sector also remains under pressure following the marked fall in building plans passed in the first quarter of this year, with the negative trend continuing into April. The continued poor performance of gross fixed capital formation contributes to the weak state of the economy. Although private sector investment recorded positive growth after five consecutive quarters of contraction, at a growth rate of 1.2% it remains very subdued. Given the extremely low level of business confidence, a near- term improvement is unlikely. Policy uncertainty, a recent example being in the mining sector, is likely to constrain investment. As a consequence, employment growth has been minimal, and the prospects are unfavourable. Given the need for fiscal consolidation, a continued decline in government\\xd5s contribution to employment creation is expected. The official unemployment rate increased to 27.7% in the first quarter of this year. Consumption expenditure by households contracted in the first quarter of this year, amid a further deterioration in consumer confidence. Although the monthly retail sales data suggest a more positive outcome for the second quarter, this improvement is likely to be offset in part by a decrease in new vehicle sales in the quarter. The outlook    for consumption expenditure is expected to remain weak, amid employment uncertainty and higher tax burdens. These consumption trends are mirrored in the continued moderation in credit extension to households. Growth in mortgage advances and instalment sales credit finance remained subdued, reflective of the difficult conditions in the housing and vehicle markets. General loans to households increased moderately in May, but off a low base. Credit extension to the corporate sector, by contrast, remains relatively buoyant, but on a downward trend. Wage trends have been an important contributor to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. There are, however, indications of some moderation in average salaries, and related unit labour costs, which are expected to remain below the 6% level over the forecast period. The outcome of a number of multi-year wage agreements that are due for renewal in 2017 will be closely watched as they could pose a risk to the inflation trajectory. The persistent global oil supply glut, along with increased shale gas production in the US, have undermined efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices through output restrictions. Since the beginning of June, Brent crude oil prices have traded at levels below US 50 per barrel, and the Bank\\xd5s oil price assumptions have been revised down over the forecast period. These recent oil price trends, along with the stronger exchange rate, contributed to a 69 cent per litre reduction in the petrol price in July. Following a weakening of the rand and a partial recovery in crude oil prices, a moderate petrol price increase is expected in August.    The inflation outlook has improved significantly since the previous meeting of the MPC and has been fairly broad-based. The lower core inflation outlook is indicative of weaker underlying inflation pressures, at a time when the impact of exogenous shocks on headline inflation has been dissipating. These shocks include drought-induced food price inflation and to a lesser extent international oil price increases earlier this year that have since been reversed. A number of risks to the inflation outlook persist and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be broadly balanced. Although the rand has been relatively resilient, it remains vulnerable to heightened political uncertainty, global monetary policy developments and possible further credit ratings downgrades. On the positive side, it is supported by a sustained narrowing of the current account deficit and positive investor sentiment towards emerging markets. A further upside risk relates to the possible supply side shock of a large electricity tariff increase from July next year. Eskom has approached Nersa for an increase of around 20%, but the current forecast assumes an increase of 8%. This assumption will be adjusted in line with any new determinations made by Nersa. The MPC also remains concerned that inflation expectations remain sticky at the upper end of the target range. To the extent that these expectations are formed adaptively, they should adjust downwards if the lower inflation trajectory is sustained. The MPC would prefer expectations to be anchored closer to the mid-point of the target range. Underlying demand in the economy is extremely weak and the MPC is concerned about the deterioration in the growth outlook over the forecast period. This decline is broad-based. It is unclear where the drivers of accelerated growth will come from in the absence of credible structural policy initiatives that will reduce uncertainty and increase business and consumer confidence. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside.    Given the improved inflation outlook and the deteriorated growth outlook, the MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points with effect from 21 July 2017, to 6.75% per annum. Four members preferred a reduction, while two members preferred an unchanged stance. As we have emphasised on numerous occasions, the MPC does not view monetary policy as the solution to the structural growth constraints in the economy. Nor does it believe that a reduction in interest rates will provide a significant stimulus to growth in the current environment of low confidence and political uncertainty. It will however provide some relief at the margin. In this highly uncertain environment, future policy decisions will be dependent on data outcomes and our assessment of the balance of risks. We remain vigilant and would not hesitate to reverse this decision should the inflation outlook and risks deteriorate.

       "5 Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  The South African economy recorded positive growth during the second quarter of 2017 following two consecutive quarters of contraction. Growth prospects, however remain subdued as domestic fixed investment contracted further amid low business confidence. The inflation forecast has increased marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with increased uncertainty regarding a number of the main drivers. The global economy is on a recovery path. Inflation has moderated in the emerging economies and remains benign in most advanced economies. The FOMC statement yesterday confirmed the gradual pace of reduction of its balance sheet and normalisation of its policy rate. Along with continued accommodative policies by the ECB, this is expected to contribute to the continuation of favourable prospects for capital flows to emerging economies.    The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 4.8% in August, up from 4.6% previously, marginally below the Bank\\xd5s short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation surprised on the downside, moderating from 6.8% to 5.7%. Meat prices continued to accelerate in August, having measured 15.0%, but the lower cereal prices contributed to the slowing momentum. The Bank\\xd5s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.7% in July and 4.6% in August in line with the short-term forecast. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods declined from 4.0% in June to 3.6% in July. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 3.3% in July, but the divergent trend of manufactured meat prices continued with an increase of 17.8%. This trend was also evident in agricultural prices, where the subcategory of \\xd2live animals\\xd3 increased by 31.7%, while \\xd2products of crops and horticulture\\xd3 declined by 26.9%. The Bank\\xd5s forecast for headline CPI inflation is unchanged at an annual average of 5.3% in 2017, and revised up by 0.1 percentage point to 5.0% and 5.3% in 2018 and 2019. A lower turning point of 4.6% is still expected in the first quarter of 2018. The same pattern is observed in the forecast for core inflation which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, but adjusted up to 4.9% and 5.0% for the next two years. These forecasts do not incorporate the most recent inflation outcome. The main drivers of these changes are a lower repurchase rate, a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, a slightly narrower output gap and a marginal adjustment to the food price forecast as meat prices continue to surprise on the upside. Food price    inflation is forecast to reach a low turning point of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2018, and to average 7.3% in 2017, and 5.2% and 5.6% in 2018 and 2019. There may be some downside risk to this forecast in light of the August food inflation outcomes. The electricity tariff assumption remains unchanged at 8.0% from July next year, but there may be some upside risk to this assumption, given Eskom\\xd5s recent application to Nersa. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2017 continue to be relatively anchored at the upper end of the target range. Despite a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the average expected inflation for 2017 to 5.7%, expectations remain unchanged at 5.8% and 5.9% for the next two years. Expectations of analysts and business people moderated - although the latter remain above the target range - while those of trade unionists increased marginally. A welcome development is that average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 5.9% to 5.6%. This is the lowest level recorded since long-term expectations were first surveyed in 2011. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.2%. Global conditions remain generally favourable despite some geopolitical risks. The upswing appears to be synchronised, with increased world trade volumes. Growth in the US is forecast to remain above potential in the short to medium term, with the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes expected to have only a limited and short- lived impact on growth. The improved growth performance in the euro area also appears to be sustained and region-wide, while the Japanese economy has    experienced moderate growth in the past few quarters. By contrast, growth in the UK has slowed, following weak investment in the face of the Brexit headwinds. The outlook for emerging markets is also relatively positive amid generally improving fundamentals. Despite the improved growth outlook, global inflation pressures remain benign, particularly in the advanced economies. These trends are likely to contribute to the persistence of accommodative monetary policy stances in Japan and the euro area, where the recent appreciation of the euro is likely to dampen inflation pressures further. As expected, the US Fed yesterday announced a gradual reduction of its balance sheet. The process had been communicated previously and was largely priced in by the financial markets. The pace of policy rate normalisation is also expected to remain measured, as inflation continues to surprise on the downside, despite tightening labour market conditions. The stance of US fiscal policy is a source of uncertainty. Although tax reductions could lead to a faster pace of monetary tightening, the prospect of significant tax reforms has receded over time. The rand exchange rate traded in a range of between R13.54 and R12.74 since the previous meeting of the MPC, driven in part by movements in the major currencies. Over this period, the rand depreciated by 2.8% against the US dollar, by 6.2% against the euro, and by 4.5% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand remains sensitive to political developments, weak economic growth prospects and the risk of further sovereign ratings downgrades. However, it has been supported by persistent trade account surpluses and associated narrowing of the current account deficit.    The rand has also been supported by the relatively accommodative global monetary policy settings. These have contributed to sustained demand for high-yielding emerging market bonds. Net purchases by non-residents of South African government bonds have amounted to R(63) billion year to date. The domestic yield curve relative to other peer emerging market economies remains attractive to non-residents despite a decline in the curve across all maturities. However, longer-term bond yields and the rand remain vulnerable to a large non-resident sell-off in the event of further credit ratings downgrades resulting in South Africa falling out of the global bond indices. The domestic economic growth outlook remains constrained despite the higher-than- expected growth outcome of 2.5% in the second quarter of this year. This broad-based improvement, while welcome, is not expected to have a significant impact on the annual growth outcome. The Bank\\xd5s forecast for GDP growth for 2017 has been revised up marginally from 0.5% to 0.6%, while the forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have remained unchanged at 1.2% and 1.5%. This outlook is consistent with the Bank\\xd5s leading business cycle indicator which has been weakening since the beginning of the year, indicative of muted growth prospects. Business confidence also remains at very low levels, despite the slight improvement in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index during the third quarter. All the major sectors, apart from construction, recorded positive growth in the second quarter, with a particularly strong performance in the agricultural sector. The recovery in the manufacturing sector followed three successive quarterly contractions, while the tertiary sector reversed its one quarter contraction. The limited monthly data for the third quarter present a mixed picture at this stage. Mining sector output contracted in    July while manufacturing recorded positive growth. However, the Absa PMI has averaged 43.5 index points in the first two months of the quarter, suggesting continued headwinds for the sector. The underlying weakness in the economy is evident in the 2.6% contraction in gross fixed capital formation during the second quarter. Of particular concern is the 6.9% decline in private sector fixed investment, reflecting the low levels of business confidence. This subdued outlook is expected to persist against a backdrop of continued political and policy uncertainty. These investment trends do not bode well for employment creation in the economy. Total employment declined in the second quarter of 2017 and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 27.7%. The public sector, previously the main source of employment growth in the economy, is likely to continue to shed jobs as fiscal constraints intensify. Consumption expenditure by households rebounded strongly in the second quarter following the sizeable contraction in the previous quarter. Spending on all three major goods components recovered, but expenditure on services contracted. Despite the improved outcome, the outlook for consumption expenditure growth remains subdued, although positive, amid very low levels of consumer confidence. Month-on-month retail trade sales decreased in July, but motor vehicle sales remained relatively strong in July and August. The Bank expects household consumption growth to be in the region of 1% for this year.    The underlying drivers of household consumption expenditure remains unchanged. Lower inflation, lower interest rates and higher real income growth are expected to provide some support for consumption. Offsetting effects include depressed consumer confidence, weak employment growth, the absence of significant wealth effects, and the prospect of further tax increases in the wake of fiscal revenue shortfalls. In addition, growth in credit extension to the private sector has declined steadily over the past few months, as corporate demand for mortgage finance and general loans in particular moderated. Growth in credit extension to households remains weak and negative in real terms. These trends are also reflected in continued household deleveraging, with household debt to disposable income declining further to 72.6% in the second quarter, its lowest level since the beginning of 2006. International oil prices have increased by about US 5 per barrel since the previous meeting, with Brent crude oil currently trading at around US 55 per barrel. Nevertheless, the MPC does not expect a further sustained acceleration in prices as the flexibility of US shale oil production is expected to provide a ceiling to prices. The previous oil price assumptions therefore remain unchanged. The domestic price of 95 octane petrol has increased by a cumulative 86 cents per litre since August, mainly due to higher international product prices. A further moderate increase is expected in October.    The MPC expects inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period, closer to the mid-point than was the case early in the year. Core inflation has remained relatively stable, indicative of the absence of significant demand pressures. However, a number of risks to the inflation outlook have increased and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be somewhat on the upside. The rand remains a key upside risk to the inflation outlook. Furthermore, some of the event risks, particularly those of a political nature, are now more imminent but with no greater degree of clarity regarding the outcome. The prospect of a further ratings downgrade persists, particularly given the increased fiscal challenges and political uncertainty. The narrower current account deficit and the global environment remain supportive of the rand. However, should inflation and/or growth surprise on the upside in Europe and in the US in particular, we could see a faster pace of monetary tightening, which could impact on capital flows and the rand exchange rate. At this stage, the markets appear to be pricing a high probability of an increase in the Federal funds rate in December, and three further increases next year. A further upside risk relates to the possibility of a large electricity tariff increase than is currently assumed in our forecast from July next year. A tariff increase of 20% could raise the headline inflation forecast by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points, and the MPC will continue to assess the possible second round effects of these increases. The MPC remains concerned that inflation expectations of business people and trade unions remains above or close to 6% for the next two years even though our own forecast and those of most analysts expect inflation to be much closer to 5%. Lower inflation expectations among key price setters is an important element in reducing inflation in the future, thus enabling lower nominal interest rates. Until August, food price inflation had been moderating at a slower pace than expected, mainly due to the continued acceleration in meat prices. However, the August year- on-year outcome surprised significantly on the downside. Should this lower trajectory continue, there could be a downside risk to the food price forecast, and to the overall inflation outlook, particularly in the short term. Although household consumption expenditure rebounded strongly in the second quarter, the MPC does not view this as indicative of the longer-term trend of expenditure, which is expected to remain constrained. The second quarter growth outcome, while positive, does not change our growth forecast significantly, and the outlook remains weak. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside. In light of these developments and the deteriorating assessment of the balance of the risks, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. Three members preferred an unchanged stance and three members preferred a 25 basis point reduction. Ultimately the committee decided to keep the rate unchanged. Given the heightened uncertainties in the economy, the MPC felt it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage, and reassess the data and the balance of risks at the next meeting.

       "6 Issued by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the  Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee upside risks to the inflation outlook have increased, mainly due to higher international oil prices and a weaker rand exchange rate. Despite a deterioration in the forecast, inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period. Domestic event risks, including rating agency reviews and the economic policy implications of the ANC electoral conference, are likely to dominate rand movements over the coming weeks. The domestic growth outlook remains weak, continuing its deviation from the generally more favourable global pattern. Stronger world growth has contributed to a further increase in international oil prices, which could, in turn, provide a boost to global inflation. This may increase the pace of monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies, with possible implications for capital flows to emerging markets.    The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4.8% in October, down from 5.1% previously, marginally below the Bank\\xd5s short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation continued to moderate, measuring 5.3% in October, down from 5.5% in September, but meat price inflation remained elevated at 15.5%. The Bank\\xd5s measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.5% in October compared with 4.6% previously. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased in August and September, to 4.2% and 5.2% respectively, having recorded a low of 3.6% in July. The higher trend was driven to a large extent by higher international oil prices and a weaker exchange rate. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 1.3% in September, but manufactured meat price inflation remained elevated at 16.5%. At the agricultural level, prices of live animals increased by 26.7%, suggesting that it may take some time for meat price inflation to normalise. The inflation forecast generated by the Bank\\xd5s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows a deterioration since September. The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 5.3%, but has been revised upward for 2018 and 2019 to 5.2% and 5.5%, from 5.1% and 5.4% previously. The lower turning point, which is expected in the first quarter of 2018, increased from 4.5% to 4.7%. The main upside drivers of these changes are a weaker exchange rate path in 2018 in particular, a higher international oil price, and higher average wage growth. These pressures are offset to some extent by a more favourable food price forecast in 2018 in particular. Following a number of downside surprises, food price inflation is now expected to reach a low turning point of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared    with 4.7% previously. Average increases of 4.5% and 5.9% are now expected in 2018 and 2019, compared with previous forecasts of 5.3% and 5.9%. Furthermore, the endogenously determined path of the repo rate in the QPM also provides an offsetting effect. This path implies three interest rate increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2019, compared with one increase previously. As we elaborate later, this does not imply an unconditional commitment to this policy path. The forecast for core inflation, which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, has been adjusted up by 0.2 percentage points in both 2018 and 2019 to 5.1% and 5.3% respectively. A low turning point of 4.6% is expected in the final two quarters of 2017. The expectations of market analysts, as reflected in the Reuters econometer survey, are similar to those of the Bank\\xd5s forecasts, with a slight deterioration since September. The survey conducted in November shows median forecasts of 5.2% for 2018 and 5.5% for 2019. Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation linked bond yields have increased, with the 5-year break-even inflation rates now close to the upper end of the target range. The global growth outlook remains positive despite some geopolitical risks. Confidence indices in a number of countries have reached their highest levels since the global financial crisis. Nevertheless the expectation is that world growth will remain below the levels seen before the crisis. The recovery in the advanced economies appears to be most sustained in the euro area, the US and Japan, but the outlook for the UK remains constrained by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. The extent to which this positive prognosis for some advanced economies is predicated on continued monetary accommodation is still unclear.    The outlook for emerging markets remains mixed but generally favourable, with prospects for oil producers boosted by higher oil prices. There are, however, some concerns about possible headwinds from slowing momentum in the Chinese economy. Inflation pressures are mostly benign in the advanced economies although there are some incipient near-term risks from higher international oil prices. Low wage growth is seen as a brake on core inflation pressures, despite relatively tight labour market conditions. The US Fed is expected to maintain a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening, with a further policy rate increase widely expected in December. The ECB has signalled a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases from next year, but expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time. The Bank of Japan has also maintained a highly accommodative policy stance. By contrast, the Bank of England raised its Bank rate in November in response to inflation pressures driven by the depreciation of the pound. The outlook for continued capital flows to emerging markets therefore remains relatively favourable despite the slowdown in bond flows in the past few weeks. However, the risk of a faster pace of monetary tightening in the US in particular, in the event of upside inflation or growth surprises, could reduce capital flows further. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand has depreciated by 3.6% against the US dollar, by 3.0% against the euro, and by 3.3% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand recorded a weak point of around R14.55 against the US dollar in mid- November, but has recovered somewhat since then. Factors that impacted on the rand during the period included the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the ANC electoral conference in December; concerns about a faster pace of    monetary tightening in the US; the negative reaction to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS); and speculation regarding the introduction of free higher education in South Africa. These latter two factors have raised the risk of sovereign ratings downgrades, a risk that has been hanging over the rand for some time. Downgrades of domestic currency debt to sub-investment grade could lead to South African government bonds falling out of key indices which require investment grade. Such an event could trigger significant sales of domestic bonds by non-residents. Ratings reviews are expected imminently, but the extent to which any possible downgrades may already be priced in remains uncertain. The lead-up to the ANC national elective conference and its uncertain outcome, is also likely to continue to weigh on the currency. Aside from these negative factors, the rand has been given some support by the continued surpluses on the trade account of the balance of payments. The Bank\\xd5s forecasts for the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP have been revised down by about half a percentage point in all three years of the forecast period, to 2.2% in 2017, and 2.9% and 3.2% in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets remains supportive of the rand. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued but positive. Both consumer and business confidence remain low and are also likely to be affected by political developments in December. The forecast for GDP growth generated by the QPM has been revised up marginally to 0.7% for 2017, but revised down to 1.2% and 1.5% for 2018 and 2019, from 1.3% and 1.7% previously. The output gap is expected to remain negative over the forecast period. The SARB\\xd5s composite    leading business cycle indicator increased further in September, consistent with a mild recovery. High frequency data suggest that the main production sectors have again contributed positively to economic growth in the third quarter. However, both the mining and manufacturing sectors experienced sharp month-on-month contractions in September. The Absa PMI has increased for three consecutive months, but at 47.8 index points remains in contractionary territory. The construction sector, which recorded negative growth in the second quarter, remains weak. Of particular concern is the sharp decline in the FNB/BER civil construction index to 15 index points in the third quarter, its lowest level since 2000. This is indicative of the poor outlook for infrastructure expenditure. Employment prospects remain unfavourable. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) conducted by Statistics South Africa, year-on-year growth of total employment measured 2.3% in the third quarter of 2017. Despite this increase, the official unemployment rate was unchanged at 27.7% for the third successive quarter. Fiscal constraints point to further job losses in the public sector. The outlook for consumption expenditure by households has improved moderately, following stronger retail trade sales in the second and third quarters. Retail trade sales recorded growth of 1.4% in the third quarter, despite month-on-month contractions in July and September. New motor vehicle sales also held up relatively well during the quarter. By contrast, wholesale trade sales contracted. The \\xd2Black Friday\\xd3 effect is likely to boost sales in the fourth quarter as well. Nevertheless consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued over the forecast period.    Favourable drivers of real consumption expenditure include positive real income and wage growth, and some positive wealth effects from higher equity prices. Although growth in credit extension to households remains negative in real terms, it has increased in recent months. Constraining factors include higher tax burdens, low employment growth and weak consumer confidence. Wage growth continues to contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Although the year-on-year pace of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy declined in the second quarter of this year, at 6.1% it was still positive in real terms. Adjusting for labour productivity, growth in nominal unit labour costs measured 6.0% in the second quarter. Unit labour cost increases are forecast to remain above the 6% level over the forecast period. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7.6% in the first 9 months of 2017. The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) published in October revealed a rapidly deteriorating fiscal position. Significant revisions were made to the expected deficits and government debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. This deterioration was mainly a result of significantly lower tax revenues, although there was also a provision for a moderate breach of the expenditure ceiling. The less favourable path of fiscal consolidation could potentially reduce the scope for further monetary policy accommodation. International oil prices have re-emerged as an upside risk to domestic and global inflation. Having reached recent lows of around US 45 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has fluctuated in the US 60-US 65 per barrel range since late    October. This is in response to increased demand, and reportedly high compliance with the output restriction agreement brokered by OPEC. While we still expect the flexibility of the shale oil producers in the US to limit the further upside potential, oil prices are expected to remain at these elevated levels for some time. The oil price assumptions in the Bank\\xd5s models have accordingly been increased moderately for both 2018 and 2019. The combination of a weaker exchange rate and higher product prices has resulted in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices by R1.00 per litre since September. The current under-recovery suggests a further increase in the region of 70 cents per litre is likely in December. The latest inflation outcomes show that headline inflation remains close to the midpoint of the target range, while core inflation has reached its lowest level in five years. However, the forecasts suggest that both measures are close to their lower turning points, and an upward trajectory is expected to begin early next year. Although inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, the risks to the outlook are assessed to be on the upside at a time when imminent key event risks contribute to an environment of particularly elevated uncertainty. These event risks affect monetary policy primarily through the exchange rate channel. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the deterioration in the fiscal stance has increased the risk of a sovereign ratings downgrade of domestic currency bonds to sub-investment grade. As noted, this could precipitate a significant sell-off of domestic government bonds by non-residents, with implications for the exchange rate and long-term bond yields. Should this occur, there is the possibility of a short-    term overreaction, and a possible partial recovery later on. The precise path and duration is highly uncertain. International oil prices have become an increasing concern. While we have adjusted our assumptions in this regard upward, a persistence of oil prices at current levels or higher pose an upside risk to the forecast. As before, a sizeable electricity tariff increase also remains a risk. We should have clarity on Eskom\\xd5s tariff application by the time of the next MPC meeting. There are very few signs of domestic demand pressures, as reflected in core inflation outcomes. Although retail sales have surprised on the upside, household consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued. The economic growth outlook remains constrained, as weak confidence continues to weigh on investment expenditure. Business and consumer confidence are likely to be sensitive to the political outcomes in December. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth outlook to be on the downside. In light of the high degree of uncertainty prevailing in the economy and the balance of risks, the MPC has decided that it would be prudent to maintain the current stance of monetary policy at this stage. Accordingly, the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 6.75% per annum. The QPM generates an endogenous interest path that implies an increase in the repo rate of 75 basis points by the end of 2019. We need to stress that this does not mean an unconditional commitment to change policy rates in line with this path. The forecasts and implied path are a broad guide to policy and not necessarily prescriptive. Depending on economic conditions, the MPC may choose to diverge from the suggested path and alternative paths could be generated that are still    consistent with achieving the inflation target. Collective judgement therefore remains critical. As always, MPC members needs to weigh the risks to the forecasts and assess the trade-offs. It is also the case that the implied path can change from meeting to meeting as the data and risks change.

</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>In recent weeks some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody Investors Service (Moody) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food fuel and electricity amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months  time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong  Black Friday effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction</span></td></tr>\n",

            & In recent weeks some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S\\&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody Investors Service (Moody) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46\\% in November down from 48\\% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37\\% from 41\\% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55\\% The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food fuel and electricity amounted to 44\\% in October compared with 45\\% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51\\% in November up from 50\\% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09\\% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53\\% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49\\% and 54\\% respectively from 52\\% and 55\\% previously Inflation is expected to average 55\\% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47\\% to 44\\% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523\\% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60\\% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80\\% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80\\% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52\\% and 60\\% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45\\% and 59\\% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48\\% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46\\% and 51\\% in 2018 and 2019 from 51\\% and 53\\% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46\\% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44\\% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58\\% to 57\\% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59\\% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56\\% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51\\%and 54\\% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55\\% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54\\% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131\\% against the US dollar by 96\\% against the euro and by 106\\% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07\\% to 09\\% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14\\% and 16\\% respectively up from 12\\% and 15\\% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months  time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4\\% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277\\% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26\\% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199\\% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong  Black Friday effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13\\% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63\\% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68\\% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61\\% to 55\\% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6\\% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55\\% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675\\% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction\\\\\n",

                                   | In recent weeks some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody Investors Service (Moody) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food fuel and electricity amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months  time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong  Black Friday effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction | \n",

       "1 In recent weeks some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference Also Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade Moody Investors Service (Moody) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade A further downgrade therefore remains a risk and will depend on government response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies Against this more positive backdrop the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range At the same time domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside in large part due to the recovery in the agricultural sector While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast the outlook remains challenging The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 46% in November down from 48% previously Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline Goods price inflation moderated to 37% from 41% previously while services price inflation was unchanged at 55% The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food fuel and electricity amounted to 44% in October compared with 45% previously Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 51% in November up from 50% in October Food products price inflation moderated further to 09% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices Meat price inflation however remains elevated as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt The inflation forecast generated by the SARB Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 53% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 49% and 54% respectively from 52% and 55% previously Inflation is expected to average 55% in the final quarter of 2019 The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 47% to 44% The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption following the 523% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) This adjustment takes effect from July when a 60% increase is assumed in the CPI compared with 80% previously The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 80% These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 06 and 01 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April Food price inflation is now expected to average 52% and 60% in 2018 and 2019 respectively up from 45% and 59% previously The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 48% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 46% and 51% in 2018 and 2019 from 51% and 53% respectively Whereas previously a lower turning point of 46% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017 a low of 44% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018 The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation Higher wage pressures by contrast are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation Average inflation expectations for 2018 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from 58% to 57% but remain close to the upper end of the target range Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 59% as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 56% These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey with business people revising their expectations higher over the two years offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials The expectations of market analysts which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January also show a slight improvement since November The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 01 percentage points to 51%and 54% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 55% Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 54% The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised although uneven across regions However some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019 Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms but the extent of this is still unclear The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general with upward growth revisions in most regions although less so for Latin America and Africa Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks Global inflation trends by contrast remain subdued although there are indications of emerging upside pressures driven in part by higher energy prices Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular and are expected to intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist Monetary policies in the advanced economies particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK) are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference and since then has traded in a range of between R1225 and R1250 against the US dollar This is in sharp contrast to the low of R1447 a month earlier Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the rand has appreciated by 131% against the US dollar by 96% against the euro and by 106% on a trade-weighted basis In the near term the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth However the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement although off a low base This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong recovery in the agricultural sector The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 07% to 09% for 2017 while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 14% and 16% respectively up from 12% and 15% previously This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter but still positive On a month-to-month basis mining output increased in October but declined in November while manufacturing output increased in both these months However the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) to 449 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector More positively the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months  time improved markedly Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter following a contraction in the previous quarter All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4% The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility This process could take some time At this stage the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year with a slight improvement in 2019 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 277% The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that during the third quarter of 2017 formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 26% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 199% in expenditure on durable goods mainly motor vehicles Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales However the strong  Black Friday effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown Despite being relatively constrained the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved with annual average real growth rates of around 13% expected over the forecast period This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing consistent with improved motor vehicle sales Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector while more robust has been on a downward trend for some time Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 63% in the second quarter of 2017 to 68% in the third quarter However adjusting for labour productivity growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 61% to 55% Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US dollar 70 per barrel for Brent crude oil These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers as well as increased global demand At this stage it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US dollar 62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019 Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February should current trends persist The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 55% in the final quarter of next year This remains above the midpoint of the target range The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside though the degree of the upside risk has subsided Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa local-currency debt as sub-investment grade The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear Furthermore the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R1290 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk In addition the pressures are now even more intense with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy This would also support business and consumer confidence The second risk relates to international oil price developments Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside and further upward adjustment may be required in the future Demand pressures are benign with core inflation pressures relatively contained While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth it remains constrained The economic growth outlook is also more positive but fragile At this stage the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously the third increase is now a marginal call Furthermore the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 675% per annum Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction"
