Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank   Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) there has been some improvement in global financial market sentiment, but economic growth prospects in a number of the major advanced economies or regions remain constrained. Downside risks to the outlook persist as the structural problems in many countries, and in the Eurozone in particular, are still unresolved. Monetary policy in most countries is likely to remain accommodative in the absence of clear evidence of a sustained recovery, particularly against the backdrop of a relatively benign global inflation environment.   Despite a generally positive reaction to the ANC elective conference, ongoing labour conflict, the proposed scaling down of mining operations and ratings agency downgrades are symptomatic of the challenging domestic outlook. In the absence of coherent and consistent structural policy initiatives domestic economic growth is expected to continue to be well below both what is possible and required to make significant inroads into unemployment. In contrast to the situation in most advanced economies, the risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside, due in large part to continued exchange rate and wage cost pressures.   The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,7 per cent in December 2012, up from 5,6 per cent in November. The categories of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 3,5 percentage points of the inflation outcome. Food price inflation moderated from 7,5 per cent in November to 7,0 per cent, mainly as a result of lower meat and grain price increases. Core inflation, as measured by the exclusion of food, petrol and electricity from CPI, which had been unchanged at 4,7 per cent since September, increased to 4,9 per cent in December, mainly as a result of increases in services price inflation, and in line with the Bank’s forecast. Administered prices increased by 8,8 per cent, and by 7,6 per cent excluding petrol.   Having reached a recent low of 4,2 per cent in September 2012, year-on-year producer price inflation increased to 5,2 per cent in both October and November. This reversal of the previous downward trend was mainly due to price increases in mining and quarrying, agricultural products and manufactured food. Agricultural prices increased at year-on-year rates of 6,3 per cent and 5,9 per cent in October and November respectively, while manufactured food prices increased at rates of 10,9 per cent and 11,1 per cent in these months, respectively.   The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a further deterioration in the inflation outlook for 2013 compared with the previous forecast. The forecasts do not yet incorporate the new CPI weights and rebasing recently announced by Statistics South Africa, but these changes will be incorporated formally into the Bank’s next forecast. The impact on the inflation trajectory is likely to be marginal. Having averaged 5,6 per cent in 2012, inflation is now expected to average 5,8 per cent in 2013, and 5,2 per cent in 2014 compared with the previous forecasts of 5,5 per cent and 5,0 per cent for the respective years. Inflation is expected to peak at 6,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2013 and then to moderate gradually to 5,1 per cent in the final two quarters of 2014. This deterioration is largely due to higher expected food price inflation, the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand and higher expected unit labour costs.   The forecast of core inflation is more or less unchanged, indicating the continued absence of significant demand pressures. This measure is expected to peak at 5,0 per cent in the first two quarters of 2013, and to average 4,9 per cent and 4,5 per cent in 2013 and 2014, respectively.   Inflation expectations remain anchored at around the upper end of the inflation target range. According to the Survey of Inflation Expectations conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research in the fourth quarter of 2012, inflation is expected to average 6,1 per cent in 2013 and 6,2 per cent in 2014. This represents a marginal increase of 0,1 percentage point for 2013 compared with the previous survey, while the forecast for 2014 is unchanged. Business executives are the most pessimistic about inflation, having raised expected inflation rates to 6,6 per cent and 6,7 per cent in 2013 and 2014, while trade union respondents reduced their forecasts to 6,1 per cent and 6,6 per cent respectively for these years. The forecasts of financial analysts increased marginally but remain within the target range for the forecast period. For the past four quarters expectations for the next 5 years have remained unchanged at 6,2 per cent.   The global growth outlook remains challenging, notwithstanding improved sentiment in global financial markets following the interim deal related to the fiscal cliff in the US. The fiscal issues have not been fully resolved, with decisions on expenditure cuts and the debt ceiling delayed till later this year.  While the worst-case fiscal scenario has been avoided, the uncertain fiscal outlook is likely to contribute to continued sub-trend US growth. On the positive side, there are continued signs of a recovery in the US housing market and improved corporate profitability.   Although sovereign debt risks in the Eurozone have subsided for now and bond spreads on peripheral European debt have narrowed significantly, the region is likely to remain in recession for much of the year, as fiscal tightening and balance sheet repair by banks and households continue. The unemployment rate has now reached 11,8 per cent with youth unemployment at 24 per cent. The outlook for Germany, the main growth driver in the region, has also deteriorated. Growth prospects in the UK remain relatively weak, while the outlook for Japan is uncertain despite the announcement of substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimuli.   The outlook for emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, is more positive. The Chinese economy appears to have stabilised following concerns about a possible hard landing, and consensus forecasts suggest some growth acceleration in 2013 in both China and India. Growth in Africa is expected to be sustained at rates in excess of 5 per cent, while Latin American growth is expected to be more restrained, but an improvement on 2012.   The rand exchange rate continues to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The exchange rate has been impacted by the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments during 2012 and changing global and domestic risk perceptions, particularly relating to the adverse developments in the South African labour market, and the downgrades by the various ratings agencies. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has been fairly volatile, having appreciated initially from R8,94 to the US dollar, to R8,45 at the end of the year, but subsequently depreciated to current levels of around R9,00. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has depreciated by 6,1 per cent on a trade weighted basis and by about 6,6 per cent against the US dollar.   While the rand is expected to remain sensitive to domestic and global developments and continued volatility can be expected, most analysts do not expect significant further sustained depreciation in the coming months. The depreciation of the rand is expected to help moderate the current account imbalance, although platinum export growth may be undermined to some extent by possible shaft closures. However, financing of the deficit may be  more challenging despite relatively high domestic nominal bond yields, as sentiment towards South Africa has deteriorated, and non-residents already hold over one-third of the stock of outstanding government bonds.   Non-resident net purchases of domestic bonds totalled R88,6 billion during 2012 due in part to South Africa’s inclusion in the Citibank World Government Bond Index. However the pace of inflows declined substantially in the final quarter of the year, when net purchases amounted to R10,6 billion. Since the beginning of 2013, net purchases by non-residents have amounted to R4,3 billion. While non-residents were net sellers of equities during 2012 to the value of R3,4 billion, they were net buyers to the value of R7,3 billion in November and December. Year to date, however, the negative trend regarding equities has continued with net sales of R2,3 billion as growth prospects remain weak.   Domestic economic growth remains fragile and below potential following an annualised growth rate of 1,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2012, and an estimated growth rate of around 2,5 per cent for the year. A similar outcome is expected in 2013 with growth of 2,6 per cent forecast, revised down from 2,9 per cent in the previous forecast. A more favourable outcome of 3,8 per cent is forecast for 2014, compared with 3,6 per cent previously, driven in part by a more favourable global outlook. However, the risks to these forecasts are assessed to be on the downside, given uncertainties and instability in parts of the mining and agricultural sectors in particular. Constraints to growth are both external and internal. To achieve a higher internally-generated growth rate would require a serious commitment to implementing a range of structural reforms and making the necessary trade-offs as outlined in the National Development Plan.   The outlook for parts of the mining sector is bleak, following continued labour disputes and announcements of possible closures of shafts and mines, a consequence of increased cost pressures, weak global demand and prices. Although mining output increased on a month-to-month basis in November, on a three-month-to-three-month basis a contraction of 10,4 per cent was recorded. There are mixed signals pertaining to the outlook for the manufacturing sector. The real volume of manufacturing production increased by 2,3 per cent in November, its highest month-on-month rate in 4 years, due in part to a rebound from widespread strike activity in previous months, and growth in the fourth quarter is estimated to have been relatively robust. Capacity utilisation has also increased.  However, the Kagiso PMI declined to below the 50 index point level to 47,4 in December, indicating an expectation of some contraction in the sector.   The negative business sentiment evident in the confidence indicators is also reflected in the continued weakness in private sector gross fixed capital formation. Recent developments in the mining sector are likely to reinforce this weakness as plans are scaled back. Investment expenditure is likely to remain underpinned by the government and state-owned enterprises. In the third quarter of 2012, gross fixed capital formation grew at an annualised rate of 7,2 per cent, but private sector capital formation, which accounts for just under two thirds of the total, only grew at a rate of 2,8 per cent.   Growth in consumption expenditure by households moderated as expected in the third quarter of 2012 when it increased by 2,6 per cent. The main driver of the moderation was the decline in expenditure growth on services and non-durable goods. However there are also signs of moderation in the growth of expenditure on durable and semi-durable goods, and the depreciated exchange rate is likely to sustain this trend. Growth in motor vehicle sales has slowed in recent months, and there was a marked decline in the confidence of new vehicle traders reported by the BER. Despite the higher-than-expected increase in retail trade sales in November, the quarterly rates suggest further moderation in growth. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index declined by 2 index points to -3 index points in the final quarter of 2012.   On balance, the MPC does not assess growth in household consumption expenditure to be excessive or to pose significant inflationary risks, and further moderation is possible. Factors that affect the outlook for consumption expenditure, both positively and negatively, include concerns regarding employment, wage settlements, credit extension particularly unsecured lending, and administered price increases which impact on discretionary spending.   The upward momentum of banks’ total loans and advances to the private sector has continued, with twelve-month growth of 9,9 per cent recorded in November, the highest growth rate since February 2009. Excluding mortgage advances, which remain subdued, the increase in November was 18,3 per cent. Bank credit extension to the household sector increased by 10,4 per cent. General loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, while still exhibiting rates of growth in excess of 30 per cent, shows some signs of moderation amid reports that banks are becoming more cautious in extending new loans in this category. Access to new loans may also be constrained by the increased size of outstanding debt. However, despite rising debt levels, household debt to disposable income appears to have stabilised at around 76 per cent.   The MPC remains concerned about the potential impact of the higher level of wage settlements on employment and inflation. There are indications that wage increases are trending higher, with growth in nominal remuneration per worker increasing from 7,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2012 to 8,1 per cent in the third quarter. Once productivity increases are accounted for, this translates into unit labour cost increases of 6,1 per cent and 6,7 per cent in these respective quarters. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7,4 per cent in the first nine months of 2012.   The MPC is mindful of the danger of a possible wage-price spiral and further employment losses should unaffordable real wage demands be granted while economic growth remains constrained. The risk to inflation should this scenario play itself out are significant in the absence of productivity gains.   The subdued pace of employment creation in the private sector has been further undermined by the fractious nature of recent wage negotiations and the announcement of further possible restructuring in the mining sector which would involve the closure or mothballing of mines or shafts. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa, non-agricultural formal sector employment grew by 1,0 per cent or 82,000 employees in the year to September 2012. Almost two thirds of this increase was accounted for by the public sector, while net job losses over this period were experienced in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with employment in the mining sector unchanged. However, in the third quarter of 2012, 15,000 jobs were shed in the mining sector and there are fears that this trend could continue. Employment in the agricultural sector, which is not covered by the survey, is also at risk.   Food prices continue to pose a significant near-term risk to the inflation outlook, although there are signs that these price pressures may moderate during the year as a result of favourable base effects, as well as the recent moderation in global and domestic wheat and maize prices. The price of these commodities will also be influenced by developments in the exchange rate of the rand and unpredictable weather patterns.   Administered prices remain on average well in excess of the upper end of the target range, and there is as yet no clarity about the new Eskom tariffs to be implemented later this year. At this stage a 16 per cent tariff increase is assumed in the forecast. International oil prices have remained relatively stable for the past few months and are more or less unchanged from the previous meeting of the MPC.  Futures prices reflect an expectation of some moderation in coming months, but some volatility can be expected. The domestic price of petrol, which is also impacted by the exchange rate, declined by a cumulative 34 cents per litre since early November, but much of this decline is likely to be reversed in February.   The MPC continues to assess the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside. While the risks to the forecast emanating from food prices may have diminished somewhat, particularly over the medium term, the exchange rate and wage settlements remain the key upside risk factors. While the reweighting and rebasing of the CPI is still to be finalised, the impact is likely to be marginal, but on the upside. Core inflation trends indicate that demand pressures are relatively contained, and household consumption expenditure has continued to moderate.   Risks to economic growth are assessed to be on the downside, particularly given the uncertain outlook for the mining industry and ongoing unsettled labour relations. The negative output gap is therefore expected to persist. The MPC remains concerned about the possibility of a wage-price spiral and its potential to exacerbate the high level of unemployment in the economy. As we noted in the previous MPC statement, concerted action is needed on the part of all the parties involved. We need cohesion of policy and decision making to provide the necessary certainty for sustainable economic growth and development.   The monetary policy stance remains accommodative and appropriate, with the real policy rate remaining slightly negative, notwithstanding the expected temporary breach of the inflation target. However, further accommodation at this stage is constrained by the upside risks to the inflation outlook. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. As always, the MPC will monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act in a manner consistent with its mandate.     Gill Marcus GOVERNOR

20 March 2013 

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank There are a number of key developments that this meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had to consider, not least among them on the domestic front the challenge of moderate growth, rising inflation, a depreciated currency, a wider current account deficit as well as difficult labour relations and unemployment that remains stubbornly high. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the domestic inflation outlook has deteriorated slightly. Risks posed by the depreciation of the rand exchange rate have overshadowed the more favourable developments, including lower electricity price increases and some moderation in food price inflation. Nevertheless inflation is expected to remain contained within the target range apart from a temporary breach in the third quarter of 2013. The domestic 2 economic growth prospects remain fragile amid continued tensions in the labour market, particularly in the mining sector. The global economy is still characterised by a multispeed recovery. However, recent events in Europe, particularly as they affect Cyprus, have increased risk and uncertainty in the region, and have the potential to reignite the banking and sovereign debt crisis and undermine growth prospects further. The global outlook is also clouded by the fiscal gridlock in the United States that remains unresolved. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,9 per cent in February 2013, up from 5,4 per cent in January. The upside surprise in the February was mainly due to the increase in medical insurance costs, which resulted in the contribution to CPI from miscellaneous goods and services increasing from 0,7 percentage points to 1,1 percentage points. This category also impacted on core inflation, which increased markedly from 4,7 per cent in January to 5,3 per cent in February. Petrol prices also contributed to the upward trend having increased by 11,9 per cent. Food price inflation measured 6,3 per cent, down from a recent high of 7,5 per cent in November 2012, and its contribution to overall inflation declined from 1,0 percentage points to 0,9 percentage points. Administered prices increased by 8,9 3 per cent, and by 7,5 per cent excluding petrol, year-on-year. The producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5,8 per cent in January1. The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a slight deterioration in the inflation outlook for 2013 compared with the previous forecast. The forecasts incorporate the new CPI weights and rebasing announced by Statistics South Africa, as well as the lower electricity price increase of 8 per cent granted to Eskom by Nersa. Inflation is now expected to average 5,9 per cent in 2013 and 5,3 per cent in 2014, compared with the previous forecasts of 5,8 per cent and 5,2 per cent for these respective years. Inflation is expected to breach temporarily the upper end of the target range in the third quarter of 2013, when it is expected to average 6,3 per cent, and then to moderate gradually to 5,2 per cent in the final quarter of 2014. This deterioration is largely due to the depreciation of the rand and higher petrol prices, which more than offset the impact of the lower electricity price increases and a lower starting point. The forecast of core inflation is more or less unchanged for 2013 but higher for 2014, yet still indicates the continued absence of significant demand pressures. This measure is expected to peak at 5,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2014, and to average 4,8 per cent and 4,9 per cent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. This 1 Statistics South Africa has adopted a “stages-of-production” concept for the PPI and no longer produces one aggregated series. The five producer price series are PPI for final manufactured goods; intermediate manufactured goods; electricity and water; mining; and agriculture, forestry and fishing. The PPI for final manufactured goods is regarded as best representing the effects of price changes through the five stages of production.   4 forecast is likely to be adjusted upwards in the light of the increase in medical insurance costs announced earlier today. Inflation expectations as reflected in the Reuters survey of analysts conducted in February 2013 have remained more or less unchanged since December. Expectations remained anchored within the target range but close to the upper end, and, as with the Bank’s forecast, the peak is expected in the third quarter of 2013. The global economic outlook presents a mixed picture following a disappointing fourth quarter in most of the advanced economies. Recent data from the United States indicate positive trends in the labour market and household consumption expenditure due in part to positive wealth effects from the housing and equity markets. However, uncertainty about the possible negative impulse from fiscal tightening continues amid political differences over fiscal policy. Economic growth is still expected to remain below trend in 2013. The outlook for some of South Africa’s other main advanced-economy trading partners is less positive. The Eurozone remains in recession, and is not expected to recover before mid-2013 at the earliest. The tail risks from a sovereign debt crisis appeared to have subsided, but the uncertainty created by the inconclusive Italian general election, and the crisis in Cyprus, have renewed concerns about 5 the stability of the region. The outlook for the UK economy remains subdued against the backdrop of continued fiscal austerity. Growth prospects in the Asian economies are more positive. The Japanese economy is expected to be bolstered by positive consumer sentiment in response to fiscal and monetary stimuli, but the response on the capital expenditure side is still cautious. Nevertheless an improved growth performance is expected, particularly given the 18 per cent depreciation of the yen against the US dollar since October 2012. Growth in China is expected to be sustained at relatively robust levels as fixed investment expenditure remains strong despite a moderation in consumption expenditure growth. Growth in other emerging markets remains positive. These trends suggest that monetary policy in the advanced economies will remain accommodative for some time despite recent fears in the financial markets of an early reversal of quantitative easing in the US. The relatively weak growth outlook in the advanced economies has contributed to the subdued global inflation environment. The exchange rate of the rand continues to pose the main upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has depreciated by 8,4 per cent against the US dollar and fluctuated within a range of R8,45 and R9,26. However, given the significant realignment of global currencies, and particularly 6 the depreciation of the Japanese yen and the pound sterling against the US dollar, the trade weighted depreciation since the beginning of the year was more moderate at 5,6 per cent. Domestic factors contributing to the recent rand depreciation include continued work stoppages in parts of the mining sector, which also have the potential to disrupt electricity supplies, and the further widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which measured 6,3 per cent in 2012. Some narrowing of the deficit is expected during the course of the year in response to the depreciation, although the degree of response will be constrained by weak demand from advanced economies as well as strong infrastructure-related import demands. Mining export growth will also be dependent on the resolution of labour market issues with a resumption of full production, and on the extent of possible shaft closures. Equity and bond flows to emerging economies have generally moderated in the past few months, making for a more challenging global environment for financing the deficit. Inflows into South African bond and equity markets have, however, been sustained, and year-to-date non-resident net purchases of equities and government bonds have totaled R6,1 bn and R11,3 bn respectively. These flows have, however, been volatile, and the growing proportion of bonds owned by non-residents, currently around 37 per cent of the total outstanding stock of debt could constrain the pace of inflows. 7 The rand is likely to remain sensitive to both domestic and global developments. The exchange rate is expected to remain volatile and subject to overshooting, and further sustained depreciation would increase the upside risk to the inflation outlook. The Reuters Econometer survey conducted in February shows that most analysts still expect the rand to appreciate from current levels during the year, although the degree of dispersion is indicative of the uncertainty around these forecasts. According to this survey, the consensus forecast for the rand/US dollar  exchange rate at the end of 2013 is R8,61, with a range of forecasts between R9,19 and R7,80. Domestic growth prospects remain relatively subdued notwithstanding a better- than-expected fourth quarter GDP growth outcome and positive developments in the mining and manufacturing sectors in January. The economy grew by 2,5 per cent in 2012, having recorded annualised growth of 2,1 per cent in the fourth quarter, despite a 9,3 per cent contraction in the mining sector. The moderate pace of recovery is expected to continue in 2013. The Bank’s forecast is for growth of 2,7 per cent this year, marginally up from the previous forecast of 2,6 per cent, and 3,7 per cent in 2014, compared with a previous forecast of 3,8 per cent. The risks to these forecasts are assessed to be on the downside. The flat trajectory of the Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity is consistent with this forecast. Growth this year is therefore expected to remain 8 below potential output growth of 3,5 per cent, and this is expected to result in a slight widening of the Bank’s revised estimate of the output gap which, at 2,0 per cent, reflects the continued subdued state of the economy. The mining sector recorded year-on-year growth of 7,3 per cent in January, with 3-month-on-3-month growth of 5,4 per cent following four consecutive months of contraction. Neverthless the sector is expected to remain under pressure given the unsettled labour relations environment. The outlook for manufacturing appears to have improved, but this recovery is still very tentative. The sector grew at a year-on-year rate of 3,9 per cent in January, and by 1,8 per cent on a 3-month-on-3-month basis. This was consistent with improvements in the Kagiso Purchasing Managers Index, which increased from 49,1 in January to 53,6 in February. Growth in gross fixed capital formation, which measured 5,7 per cent in 2012, has been on a moderate upward trend since 2009, driven mainly by investment growth of around 9 per cent by public corporations and general government. Private sector investment growth moderated from 4,6 per cent in 2011 to 3,9 per cent in 2012 due in part to excess capacity in manufacturing and electricity supply constraints. While household consumption expenditure has been the main driver of growth since 2010, its contribution to growth has been diminishing. The general absence 9 of demand pressures in the economy is reflected in the continued moderation in the growth in real consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 3,5 per cent in 2012 compared with 4,8 per cent in 2011. Nevertheless, growth in consumption of durable goods remained robust at 11 per cent, compared with demand for services which grew at only 1,8 per cent in 2012. Sales of new motor vehicles declined on both a month-on-month and on a three-month-on-three- month basis in February. Retail trade sales in January appear to reflect this weakening trend, with a 3- month-on-3-month decline of 0,7 per cent, and a lower than expected year-on- year increase of 1,9 per cent. There are indications that consumption growth may moderate further in 2013 amid slower real income growth, higher inflation, elevated household debt levels, and a possible slow-down in credit extension to consumers. Twelve-month growth in banks’ total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,9 per cent in January, following growth of 10,0 per cent in December. Loans and advances to the corporate sector grew by 7,5 per cent in January, and to the household sector by 9,9 per cent. Growth in general loans to households - mainly unsecured lending - moderated to 30,1 per cent following a recent peak growth of 39,3 per cent in June. General loans to households amounted to 8,3 per cent of total loans and advances, and 14,6 per cent of loans and advances to household. Growth in this category of lending is likely to be 10 constrained by lower income growth and high household debt levels. Household debt to disposable income measured 75,8 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. Non-mortgage debt as a percentage of total household debt increased from 37 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 to 46 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. The trend in wage settlements remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook, although recent data is somewhat contradictory. The minimum wage in the agricultural sector has been increased by 52,2 per cent, and indications from the Andrew Levy Employment Publications are that wage settlements in collective bargaining agreements picked up significantly from 6,8 per cent in the third quarter of 2012 to 8,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. According to Statistics South Africa, average salaries and wages per worker in the non-agricultural sector increased over four quarters by 7,0 per cent in the final quarter of 2012, down from 8,9 per cent in the previous quarter, while unit labour cost increases declined from 7,4 per cent to 5,7 per cent in the same period. The MPC remains concerned about the possible impact of excessively high wage increases on employment growth. Employment in the formal non-agricultural sector increased by 1,0 per cent during 2012, compared with annual employment growth of 1,6 per cent in 2011. This included employment growth of 0,2 per cent in the mining and quarrying industry and a 0,3 per cent contraction in the manufacturing sector. In the fourth quarter of 2012 mining sector employment increased by 1,000 employees, following a decline of 16,000 in the third quarter. 11 Of concern is the seasonally adjusted annualised decline of 0,7 per cent in total non-agricultural employment during the fourth quarter of 2012. The recent national government budget tabled before parliament reflects a difficult balance between a commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation and the need for counter-cyclical policy. The projected deficit of 5,7 per cent for the past fiscal year was wider than initially budgeted for, a result of lower revenue due to weaker economic growth. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is budgeted to be 5,1 per cent in the 2013/14 fiscal year, and to decline to 3,6 per cent by 2015/16. The government net debt/GDP ratio is expected to stabilise at around 40 per cent in 2015/16, well below the international benchmark for debt sustainability of around 60 per cent. There are indications that the pressures on inflation emanating from food prices may be moderating. Food price inflation at the consumer price level declined from a recent high of 7,5 per cent in November 2012 to 6,4 per cent in January and 6,3 per cent in February. A similar trend is evident at the producer price level where manufactured food inflation declined to 5,9 per cent in January, compared with a recent peak of 11,1 per cent in November 2012. Similarly, producer price inflation in agricultural products moderated from a recent high of 6,3 per cent in October 2012 to 3,5 per cent in January. Global agricultural commodity prices have declined on average by almost 20 per cent since their recent peak in 12 August 2012, and expectations are for further moderation in the absence of adverse weather shocks. Administered prices continue to put upside pressure on inflation, although lower electricity price increases from the third quarter will dampen some of these pressures. The petrol price, which has increased by a cumulative R1,24 per litre since January 2013, remains an upside risk. Although global oil prices have declined over the past few weeks, resulting in an over-recovery of the petrol price so far this month, it is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the adverse exchange rate impacts and the fuel levy increases, and a further increase in the petrol price is likely in April. The MPC continues to assess the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, mainly due to the exchange rate and wage pressures. These upside risks are mitigated in part by lower risk from food price inflation. Underlying inflation appears to be relatively contained, consistent with the moderating trend in consumption expenditure by households. The economic growth outlook is more or less unchanged from the previous meeting of the MPC, and risks to the outlook remain on the downside. The unresolved labour disputes in the mining sector pose a significant risk to the exchange rate and to economic growth through their negative impact on export revenues, employment growth and investor perceptions of South Africa. 13 However, the depreciated exchange rate provides an opportunity for the manufacturing sector in particular to become more competitive despite the challenging export environment. Ensuring that this increase in competitiveness is sustained will require improved productivity and the containment of wage and other cost pressures, which underlines the need to keep inflation under control. The MPC continues to assess the monetary policy stance to be appropriately accommodative given the persistence of the negative output gap. At the same time, further accommodation remains constrained by the upside risks to the inflation outlook. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. The Committee will continue to apply monetary policy consistent with its mandate of price stability within a flexible inflation targeting framework. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR

2013-05-23

Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The South African economy is facing a number of domestic challenges while headwinds from the fragile and uneven global recovery remain a constraint to growth. The uncertain and increasingly difficult labour relations environment continues to dominate the economic landscape, contributing to declining domestic and foreign investor confidence. The growing vulnerability of the economy to changes in sentiment has been reflected in the depreciating and volatile exchange rate, which was already under pressure from the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. Although inflation is forecast to remain relatively contained, these factors have raised the upside risks to the outlook at a time of worsening real growth prospects.   The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,9 per cent in April 2013, unchanged from the previous two months. However, the drivers of the overall rate changed somewhat. Food price inflation measured 6,3 per cent in April, reversing the downward trend that had prevailed since November 2012. The contribution of food to overall inflation remained unchanged at 0,9 percentage points while housing and utilities,  contributed 1,4 percentage points.  Administered prices increased by 8,9 per cent, and by 7,8 per cent excluding petrol. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,2 per cent, marginally up from 5,1 per cent in March. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5,7 per cent in March, up from 5,4 per cent in February.   The inflation forecast of the Bank was relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is now expected to average 0,1 percentage points lower in 2013 and 2014 at 5,8 per cent and 5,2 per cent respectively, and to average 5,0 per cent in 2015. A temporary breach of the upper end of the target range is still expected in the third quarter of 2013, but at a lower average level of 6,1 per cent (6,3 per cent previously), followed by a gradual moderation of inflation to 4,9 per cent in the final quarter of 2015. The slight improvement is due to changed assumptions about international commodity prices, including oil, and lower global inflation.   The forecast for core inflation for 2013, at an average of 5,3 per cent, is significantly higher than the forecast of 4,8 per cent previously. This follows the sharp increase in medical insurance costs in the February CPI. Core inflation is also expected to be adversely affected over the coming months by increases in a number of other administered prices, particularly water and municipal rates and taxes. This measure is expected to peak at 5,4 per cent in both the third and fourth quarter of 2013, and to average 5,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent in the coming two years. Despite the higher near-term trend, this indicator is still assessed to reflect an absence of significant demand pressures.   Inflation expectations, as reflected in the Reuters survey of analysts conducted in April, has remained relatively stable for some months. The forecast is the same as the Bank’s for 2013, although higher for the next two years but still within the target range. The relatively anchored inflation expectations at the upper end of the target range are also evident in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the first quarter of 2013. Overall, respondents expect inflation to average 6,0 per cent in both 2013 and 2014, and 6,1 per cent in 2015.   The global economic environment remains challenging, with different regions growing at varying rates. Within the advanced economies, the United States appears to be showing a number of positive signs of recovery: the University of Michigan’s consumer confidence index is at its highest in almost six years; labour market developments have been more favourable; and there are strong wealth effects from the booming equity market as well as from the recovering housing market. However, headwinds can be expected from the fiscal contraction resulting from the fiscal cliff compromise and the spending cuts that were part of the recent sequester. The impact of this contraction is expected to be as high as two percentage points of GDP.   The Eurozone remains in recession, having contracted at an annualised rate of 0,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, compared with a contraction of 2,7 per cent in the previous quarter. The French economy has recorded two consecutive quarters of negative growth, while Germany managed to avoid recession by recording annualised growth of 0,3 per cent in the first quarter of this year. The Eurozone is constrained by continued deleveraging by households, banks and governments and the region is also characterised by increasing financial fragmentation.  Although a slower pace of fiscal consolidation in the periphery has been agreed to in terms of the bail-out agreements, negative or at best very low growth is expected to persist in the region for some time.   The Japanese economy rebounded from its 2012 recession in the first quarter of 2013, but it is still too soon to assess the impact of the fiscal, monetary and structural policy stimulus packages that were announced recently. The yen exchange rate, which has depreciated by around 30 per cent against the US dollar since October 2012, is likely to contribute positively to growth.   Emerging markets remain the main global source of growth, but there are signs of moderation in some of the systemically important countries, particularly China, India and Brazil. The rebalancing of the Chinese economy away from fixed capital formation and production toward internal consumption has resulted in some slowdown, which has contributed to the declining trend of global commodity prices.   The persistence of slow global growth and weaker commodity prices have resulted in a moderation in global inflation. This is particularly the case with respect to energy prices in the advanced economies. This combination of lower inflation and slow growth prompted further monetary easing by the ECB, and with Japan yet to begin with its quantitative monetary easing, these accommodative policy stances are likely to persist for some time. While there are concerns about the possible risks posed to financial markets and global capital flows by an early reversal of the US monetary policy stance, any such action is likely to be extremely cautious, and is only expected to begin once a sustained recovery is well-entrenched. There are, however, growing concerns that the buoyant conditions in the financial markets in many countries are indicative of bubbles caused by excessive global liquidity, rather than reflecting underlying positive growth prospects.   Movements in the exchange rate of the rand continue to be impacted by external developments, but since mid-2012 these have been compounded by domestic factors which have undermined investor sentiment. The increasingly fraught labour relations environment, and high wage demands in the mining sector in particular, are likely to continue to impact adversely on the volume of mining exports against a backdrop of falling international commodity prices and concerns about the widening of the current account deficit of the balance of payments. These developments also have the potential to affect, directly and indirectly, South Africa’s credit ratings, and increase the cost of much-needed finance. The rand has also been influenced in recent weeks by the hedging related to renewable energy projects, as well as a strengthening dollar. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by around 4,6 per cent against the US dollar, and by 3,7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.   Despite the current negative sentiment towards the rand, non-residents have remained net buyers of bonds and equities this year. Since January, non-residents have been net buyers of equities to the value of R12,7 billion, and bonds to the value of R22,5 billion. However, these positive inflows can reverse very quickly in response to changing risk perceptions.  Furthermore, any hedging of these exposures, as is sometimes the case during periods of rand weakness, puts pressure on the rand even though the underlying assets are still held by non-residents.   As we have noted previously, the impact of the weaker rand on inflation is dependent on the extent, speed and duration of the depreciation, as well as the phase of the business cycle. While some of the recent decline reflects changes in the underlying fundamentals, the rand remains highly vulnerable to changes in sentiment. The rand has a tendency to overshoot in either direction, and at times for extended, but uncertain, periods making the impact on inflation difficult to forecast. The current level of the exchange rate, if sustained, poses a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook.   Domestic growth prospects remain fragile amid low consumer confidence, continued output disruptions in the mining sector, electricity supply constraints and a weak global environment. The growth forecast of the Bank has been revised down from 2,7 per cent to 2,4 per cent for 2013 and from 3,7 per cent to 3,5 per cent in 2014. Growth is expected to accelerate to 3,8 per cent in 2015. At these growth rates, the negative output gap will widen further before stabilising next year, and begin to close during 2015. This outlook is consistent with the flat trajectory of the Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity. Notwithstanding the increase in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index in the first quarter of 2013, given the difficult labour relations environment in the country and the risks to global growth, the downside risk to growth remains, as does the possibility of increased job losses.   Although the physical volume of mining production recorded a quarter-to-quarter increase of 6,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2013 following the disruptions in the previous quarter, output contracted on a month-to-month basis in both February and March. The outlook for the sector remains bleak with threats of shaft closures and retrenchments, falling commodity prices, high wage demands and a  risk of protracted periods of industrial action and further supply disruptions.     Manufacturing production declined in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the previous quarter, although the extent of the decline is complicated by the seasonal adjustment for the Easter weekend which fell over March and April. The Kagiso PMI, which increased marginally above the neutral 50 level in April, reflects the uncertain outlook for the sector. The depreciated value of the rand should improve the competitiveness of the sector, provided that gains are not eroded by rising wages and prices. The weaker rand is expected to result in some narrowing of the trade deficit. However, the subdued global demand, together with robust import volume growth driven to a large extent by infrastructure projects, suggests that the net export position will remain negative over the forecast period, and continue to be a constraint on growth. Nevertheless, the BER manufacturing confidence index, while still low, improved somewhat in the first quarter.     The outlook for household consumption expenditure, in recent years the main driver of growth, appears to have weakened with  the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index declining to a nine-year low in the first quarter of 2013. Retail sales grew at a modest quarter-to-quarter rate of 0,6 per cent in the first quarter of this year, while sales contracted on a month-to-month basis in March. This was consistent with the decline in the BER retail confidence index in the first quarter. New vehicle sales growth, while increasing significantly on a year-on-year basis, moderated to 0,1 per cent on a 3-month-to-3 month basis in April.   Consumption expenditure by households is expected to be constrained in part by lower real income growth, significant increases in the price of electricity and petrol, and high debt levels. The slowdown in expenditure growth has also been related to the moderation in some categories of credit extension by banks. Year-on-year growth in total loans and advances to the private sector moderated steadily from a recent peak of 10 per cent in December, to 8,1 percent in March 2013. Excluding the weak growth in mortgage advances, year-on-year growth in loans and advances declined from 18,5 per cent in December 2012 to 14,5 per cent in March. Although growth in unsecured lending to households remains at high levels, it has declined continuously since September 2012, to measure 27,9 per cent in March. This moderating trend is expected to continue, due in part to the increasing number of impaired advances in this category of lending at some of the banks. However the ratio of total impaired advances to total loans and advances in the banking sector continues to decline and stands at just below 4 per cent.   A number of sectors in the economy are entering into wage-bargaining rounds. The MPC is increasingly concerned about the prospect of settlements well above inflation and productivity growth and the risk of protracted and disruptive strike action, with negative implications for growth and exports. Furthermore, excessively high settlements will come at the expense of retention of employees, employment creation and could result in higher inflation. The risk of a wage-price spiral remains high. This would negate the benefits of wage increases to workers, and undermine the competitive gains of the currency depreciation. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements increased from 7,6 per cent in 2012 to 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Should this upward momentum continue, it is likely to impart an upside risk to inflation. At a time of high and rising unemployment and slowing growth, the imperative of an economy-wide commitment to wage and salary restraint at all levels, including executive pay, cannot be over-emphasised.   International oil prices are expected to remain constrained by the subdued global growth environment, but vulnerable to political developments in the Middle East in particular. Having reached a recent high of around US dollar 118 per barrel in mid-February of this year, Brent crude oil prices have remained in a range of between US dollar 97 and US dollar 105 per barrel since April. The domestic price of petrol increased by 12 cents in April, but declined by 73 cents in May, mainly as a result of lower international oil prices. Although there is currently a small average over-recovery on the petrol price, recent exchange rate movements have raised the probability of further petrol price increases in the near term.   The higher CPI food price increases in April may have reversed the favourable food price developments observed in recent months. Since the end of November 2012 to date, domestic maize prices have declined by about 17 per cent, and wheat prices by around 9 per cent. This is reflected in the producer price index for agriculture which increased at a year-on-year rate of 1,4 per cent in February and declined by 0,2 per cent in March. Manufactured food prices, by contrast, increased by 6,1 per cent and 6,3 per cent in the same months respectively, in line with CPI food price increases. The exchange rate poses an upside risk to food inflation as prices of agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize are based on international prices.   The MPC is increasingly concerned about the deteriorating outlook for the South African economy. There are a number of critical domestic issues that are contributing to the vulnerability of the economy that need to be urgently addressed. These include the financing of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments; the fractious labour relations environment and the associated risks of protracted work stoppages and excessive wage increases; electricity supply constraints; upside risks to inflation; downside risks to growth and employment creation in a context of high unemployment; and declining domestic and foreign investor confidence which could impact directly on capital flows. These interrelated developments are reflected in the volatility and weakness in the exchange rate.  There is an urgent imperative for all parties – government, business, labour and civil society – to interact and address these issues and vulnerabilities at a national level. While the Bank is prepared to play its part, many of these challenges are beyond the role, scope and effectiveness of monetary policy.   While a depreciated exchange rate is part of the balance of payments adjustment mechanism, the competitive advantages thereof need to be realised through price and wage restraint. In the absence of such restraint, the outcome is simply higher inflation with the risk of an exchange rate-inflation spiral. Given the current unsettled environment in the economy, the MPC assesses the risks to inflation to be on the upside, while many of the above factors contribute to a downside risk to growth.   The MPC assesses the current stance of monetary policy to be accommodative. Given the risks outlined above, the scope for further monetary easing is limited at this stage. The MPC has therefore decided to leave the repurchase rate unchanged at 5 per cent per annum. The MPC is ready to act appropriately in either direction in the event of material changes in the outlook.       Gill Marcus GOVERNOR

18 July 2013 

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The period since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been dominated by the reaction of the global financial markets to statements by the US Federal Reserve that a slowdown in quantitative easing may begin sooner than previously anticipated. The news impacted on capital flows to emerging markets, with outflows from bond markets in particular, but yields on long term bonds of advanced economies were also affected. While some of the initial fears have been addressed by further guidance from the Fed, this episode gives some insight into the difficulties that could be faced in fine-tuning exit strategies from highly accommodative monetary policies, particularly at a time when global growth remains weak. 2 These events had a significant impact on the exchange rate of the rand, creating further upside risks to the inflation outlook at a time when the domestic economy has shown increased signs of vulnerability. There has consequently been no let- up in the policy dilemma faced by monetary policy: that of a widening output gap in a worsening inflation environment. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas surprised on the downside at 5,6 per cent in May 2013, having measured 5,9 per cent for the previous three consecutive months. However, this decline is likely to have been temporary as it was due in part to a 73 cent per litre decrease in the petrol price in May, which has since been reversed by an 84 cent per litre increase in July. Food price inflation increased further from 6,3 per cent in April to 6,7 per cent, and accounted for 1,0 percentage point of CPI inflation. The other main contributors to the inflation outcome were housing and utilities and miscellaneous goods and services which contributed 1,4 and 1,1 percentage points respectively. Administered price inflation declined to 6,3 percent from 8,9 per cent in April due to the petrol price decline. Excluding petrol, administered price inflation was unchanged at 7,8 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,3 per cent, marginally up from 5,2 per cent in April. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 4,9 per cent in May, compared with 5,4 per cent in April. 3 Despite the lower starting point, the inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is now expected to average 0,1 and 0,3 percentage points higher in 2013 and 2014 at 5,9 per cent and 5,5 per cent respectively, while the forecast for 2015 has been raised from 5,0 per cent to 5,2 per cent. A temporary breach of the upper end of the target range is still expected in the third quarter of 2013, but at a higher average level of 6,3 per cent (6,1 per cent previously), followed by a return to within the target range by the final quarter of the year. The deterioration is mainly due to continued currency weakness and higher-than-expected petrol price increases. The forecast for core inflation for 2013 is unchanged at an average of 5,3 per cent in 2013 and is now expected to peak at 5,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. This measure is then expected to moderate and to average 5,2 per cent and 5,0 per cent in the coming two years, compared with the previous forecasts of 5,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent respectively. This upward drift in the forecast in the absence of obvious excess demand pressures suggests that there may be emerging underlying pressures, possibly due to the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate. Inflation expectations appear to have remained anchored around the upper end of the inflation target range. According to the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University during the second quarter of 2013, inflation expectations of all the categories of respondents remained almost 4 unchanged compared with those of the previous quarter. Overall, the survey found that inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2013 and 6,1 per cent in the next two years, with financial analysts’ expectations below those of the business executives and trade union officials over the whole forecast period and within the target range. The former category is consistent with the Reuters survey which reflects expectations of an average of 5,9 per cent in 2013, and moderating to 5,6 per cent and 5,4 per cent in the following two years, respectively. The global economic growth outlook has remained fragile due to the continuing deeper recession in the Eurozone and a slowdown in a number of systemically important emerging market economies. Several forecasters, including the IMF, have downgraded Eurozone growth forecasts against the backdrop of a slowdown in Germany, and continued risks emanating from Portugal, Italy and Spain. In its recent World Economic Outlook update, the IMF reduced its 2013 forecast for Eurozone growth by 0,2 percentage points to -0,6 per cent, with a weaker recovery than previously forecast in 2014. Although the US economic recovery appears to be gaining some traction, headwinds from the fiscal contraction remain, and first quarter economic growth, at an annualised 1,8 per cent, was weaker than the initial estimate of 2,5 per cent. The sustainability of the recovery is also at risk from rising long-term bond and mortgage interest rates in response to expectations of a tapering off of asset purchases by the Fed. There 5 are tentative signs of stronger growth in Japan, but the sustainability of the recovery remains uncertain. The slowing growth in various emerging market economies including China, Brazil and Russia illustrate the difficulties of decoupling from the advanced economies, with the IMF revising its forecasts for 2013 for China from 7,8 per cent to 7,5 per cent; Russia from 3,4 per cent to 2,5 per cent; and Brazil from 3,0 per cent to 2,5 per cent. The deteriorating outlook for emerging markets has been compounded by the recent capital flow reversals that impacted adversely on domestic bond and currency markets in particular. While financial markets have stabilised somewhat, the risks posed to emerging economies in general, including South Africa, by normalisation of monetary policy in the US in the future, are evident. The combination of slower growth in China and the stronger US dollar has also impacted negatively on commodity prices, although oil prices have been underpinned by risks related to recent events in Egypt. Global inflation remains benign and monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative in the advanced economies for some time, as indicated in the forward guidance provided by the ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed, notwithstanding a possible slower pace of quantitative easing in the US. By contrast, a general tightening bias is evident in a number of emerging markets in response to recent capital flow and exchange rate developments. 6 Movements in the exchange rate of the rand continue to pose the main upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC exchange rate volatility has increased and the rand generally traded in a range between R9,60 and R10,36 against the US dollar. Since the beginning of the year the rand has depreciated by 14,2 per cent against the US dollar and by 11,1 per cent on a trade weighted basis. Much of the recent volatility and weakness has been in line with the reaction of a number of other emerging market currencies to fears of US monetary policy tightening. The rand has also been negatively impacted by lower commodity prices. Domestic bond yields increased significantly in response to capital outflows and higher bond yields in the advanced economies. The yield on the 10-year government bond, for example, increased by more than 100 basis points since the financial market turbulence in late May. Net sales of domestic government bonds by non-residents amounted to R17,4 bn in May and June. In July non- residents became net buyers again with net purchases of R3,0 bn, bringing the year-to-date net total to R5,2 bn. Having been net sellers of South African equities in both 2011 and 2012, non-residents have returned to the market, with year-to-date net purchases of R23,3 bn. Despite a 15,5 per cent nominal effective depreciation of the rand exchange rate since January 2012, the pass-through to inflation has been relatively muted, 7 particularly when compared with previous episodes of currency weakness. This is probably a reflection of the weak pricing power in some sectors of the economy in a low growth environment. Nevertheless the risk remains that these pricing pressures may intensify at some stage, particularly if the exchange rate depreciates further from current levels. Market expectations are for a moderate appreciation of the rand in the coming months, although these expectations have been tempered in recent surveys. According to the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in June, analysts on average expect a rand/dollar exchange rate of R9,70 at the end of 2013, and R9,40 at the end of 2014. There is, however, a wide dispersion between the forecasters, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty. Despite a slight narrowing of the current account deficit in the first quarter of 2013 to 5,8 per cent of GDP, the depreciated currency reflects this deficit against a backdrop of declining terms of trade and more uncertain global capital flows. The outlook for domestic economic growth has weakened further, following the first quarter annualised growth rate of 0,9 per cent. While more favourable outcomes can be expected in the subsequent quarters of this year, overall annual growth is likely to be lower than the 2,5 per cent growth rate recorded in 2012. The Bank’s growth forecast for 2013 has again been revised down from 2,4 per cent to 2,0 per cent, and from 3,5 per cent to 3,3 per cent for 2014. Growth is expected to accelerate to 3,6 per cent in 2015, compared with 3,8 per cent 8 previously. The risks to the outlook are still assessed to be on the downside, particularly in the face of further delays in overcoming electricity supply constraints. In line with these subdued growth prospects, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined from 52 in the first quarter of 2013 to 48 in the second quarter, consistent with the continued sideways movement of the Bank’s leading indicator of economic activity. The outlook for the mining sector remains bleak following a 0,7 per cent year-on- year contraction in May. Although production showed positive month-to-month growth for the first time in four months, on a three-month-to-three-month basis the sector contracted by 1,4 per cent. There are indications that the manufacturing sector will make a positive contribution to growth in the second quarter following the annualised 7,9 per cent contraction in the first quarter. In May the sector expanded by 2,2 per cent on a year-on-year basis, and by 0,9 per cent on a three-month-to-three-month basis. This more positive trend is also indicated in the Kagiso PMI which increased by 1,2 index points to 52,6 in July, The real value of building plans passed remains on a moderately upward trend despite a decline in May. The FNB construction confidence index reflects some improvement, having increased by 4 points to 41 in the second quarter of 2013, although the civil construction index declined somewhat over the same period. 9 Underlying the sluggish economic growth outlook is the low growth in real gross fixed capital formation, which moderated from an annualised 4,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 2,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Private sector fixed investment growth slowed from 3,8 per cent to 2,8 per cent over this period, and reflected lower outlays in all sectors apart from agriculture, construction and finance. Work stoppages at Eskom’s Medupi plant also impacted negatively on investment by state-owned enterprises in the quarter. Fixed investment expenditure is likely to remain affected by low business confidence and prolonged electricity supply constraints. Employment growth remains subdued, particularly in the private sector. In the year from March 2012 to March 2013, employment grew by 1,0 per cent, or 80,000 workers, of which 65,000 were in the public sector, although this number was inflated by temporary appointments relating to municipal by-elections in the first quarter of the year. Employment contracted in the mining and manufacturing sectors during this period. The official unemployment rate increased from 24,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 25,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Of particular concern is the increase in the youth unemployment rate to 52,9 per cent in the first quarter. Slower growth in real consumption expenditure by households is indicative of declining consumer confidence and the relative lack of excessive demand pressures in the economy. Household Consumption expenditure growth 10 moderated to 2,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, driven mainly by more subdued demand for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles. Real retail trade sales surprised on the upside in May with year-on-year growth of 6,2 per cent. Nevertheless, retail trade sales increased by 0,5 per cent in the three months ending May compared with the previous three months, suggesting a continuation of the moderate growth in sales. Consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained by high petrol and electricity costs, high consumer debt levels and declining growth in credit extension to households. Despite a moderation in the growth of household debt in the first quarter of 2013, the ratio of household debt to disposable income was unchanged at 75,4 per cent, as growth in real disposable income also slowed. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances extended to the private sector increased by 9,3 per cent in May, but excluding mortgage advances the increase was 16,8 per cent. In the first five months of 2013, general loans (mainly unsecured lending) continued to account for the bulk of the increase in credit extension, but at a slower pace, particularly to households. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households declined from a recent peak of 35,4 per cent in September 2012 to 24,4 per cent in May 2013. The slowdown is more pronounced when measured over three months. In the three months to the end of May 2013, annualised growth was 11,3 per cent, compared with rates of increase in excess of 30 per cent during 2012. 11 One of the upside risks to inflation remains wage and salary increases. In the first quarter of 2013, a stronger upward trend was observed with growth in nominal remuneration per worker increasing from 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 7,5 per cent. With slower productivity growth, this implied an increase in unit labour cost growth from 5,2 per cent to 6,7 per cent. These increases are consistent with the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements published by Andrew Levy Employment Publications, which increased from 7,6 per cent in 2012 to 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Other upside risks to the inflation outlook emanate from food prices, which have been accelerating over the past few months following a low of 4,6 per cent in September 2012. Food price pressures are intensifying at the producer price level, with manufactured food product prices increasing by 6,9 per cent in May. Although agricultural product inflation remained subdued at 2,6 per cent, this was mainly due to the 13,0 per cent decline in live animal prices which offset the 10,4 per cent increase in cereal and other crop prices. More favourably, global food prices have declined as a result of expectations of bumper crops in some of the main grain producing countries. The FAO international cereals price index decreased by 10,1 per cent since September 2012. Global oil prices have broken out of their recent trading range of between US dollar 100 and US dollar 105, mainly due to political developments in the Middle East. 12 However, the relatively subdued global growth outlook, particularly in China, is likely to restrain these price increases. The current under-recovery of around 36 cents per litre on the domestic petrol price is mainly due to international price developments, and indicates that a further petrol price increase can be expected in August. The MPC continues to face conflicting policy choices relating to rising inflation and slowing growth. Inflation is expected to resume its upward trajectory following the brief respite in May. However, despite the upward trend in core inflation, there are no strong signs of excess demand pressures and the forecast for headline inflation suggests that the breach of the target may be short-lived. The main upside risk to the inflation outlook is the exchange rate and much will depend on the strength of the pass-through to inflation, which to date has been relatively muted. However, the risk remains that these pressures could be mounting, particularly if further currency weakness occurs and affects inflation expectations, which are currently anchored at the upper end of the target range. In addition, the outcome of the present round of wage bargaining will be critical in determining the extent of wage pressure on the inflation outlook. The output gap has widened, and is only anticipated to begin to narrow during 2015, when growth is expected to be more or less in line with potential. The downside risk to growth has already resulted in the Bank being more tolerant of 13 inflation at the upper end of the target range than would normally have been the case, an approach that is consistent with a flexible inflation targeting framework. While the upside risks to the inflation outlook reduce the scope for further accommodation, a tightening of the monetary policy stance does not automatically follow. This will be highly dependent on how we see the inflation trajectory unfolding in this very uncertain environment. In other words, it has become even more data dependent. At this stage a sustained breach of the inflation target is not our central forecast. However, we are concerned about the revised higher trajectory of core inflation and macroeconomic vulnerabilities that are increasingly evident. The MPC is mindful of these conflicting pressures and the challenging domestic and global environment, and will continue to monitor developments closely and act appropriately to achieve its mandate. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR

21 November 2013

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the headline inflation rate has returned to within the inflation target range. Despite this favourable development, inflation is expected to remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target band. Moreover, the upside risks to the inflation outlook remain elevated, dominated by uncertainties primarily relating to both the timing and the speed of the tapering of the US Fed’s bond purchasing programme. The domestic growth outlook remains fragile, with third quarter growth expected to have been adversely affected by the protracted work stoppages in the motor vehicle sector in particular, which also contributed to a decline in exports. Both business and consumer confidence remain at low levels. The MPC therefore 2 continues to face the dilemma of upside risks to inflation against a backdrop of a weaker growth outlook and a possible further depreciation of the currency. Having breached the upper end of the inflation target range in July and August, the year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 6,0 per cent in September and 5,5 per cent in October. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation surprised on the downside, moderating to 4,3 per cent from 6,0 per cent in September, and contributing 0,6 percentage points to the annual CPI increase, compared with 0,9 percentage points in the previous month. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 9,3 per cent, down from 12,8 per cent in September. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, was unchanged at 5,3 per cent, while administered price inflation excluding petrol increased marginally to 7,1 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods was unchanged in September at 6,7 per cent. The headline inflation forecast of the Bank is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The forecast average inflation rates for 2013 and 2014 are 5,8 per cent and 5,7 per cent respectively, both years 0,1 percentage point lower than in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2015 is unchanged at 5,4 per cent, with inflation expected to average 5,3 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the entire forecast period, with a peak of 5,9 per cent in the second quarter of 2014. 3 The forecast for core inflation for 2013 is unchanged at an average of 5,2 per cent, but has deteriorated for 2014 when it is expected to average 5,6 per cent compared with the forecast of 5,4 per cent previously. The forecast for 2015 remains at 5,3 per cent, ending the year at 5,1 per cent. This upward drift of the underlying inflation measure continues to be driven by the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate and the impact of higher unit labour costs. The global economy is characterised by a hesitant multispeed recovery. The outlook for the US remains positive following third quarter growth of 2,8 per cent, notwithstanding the fiscal headwinds and the unresolved budget and fiscal cliff issues, which remain downside risks. The employment data have generally been positive, prompting speculation that the Fed may begin cutting back on its programme of bond purchases sooner than previously anticipated. There is a great deal of uncertainty around the timing and pace of tapering. The timing is likely to be highly sensitive to labour market developments, and we expect the pace to be gradual to avoid undue impacts on financial markets. However, as evidenced earlier this year, the financial markets reaction will be key to the process and to spillover effects. While the UK economy also appears to be growing relatively strongly, with annualised growth of 3,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, hopes for a rebound in the Eurozone have been undermined by weak growth in the third 4 quarter. Having emerged from a prolonged recession in the second quarter, the region recorded an annualised growth rate of 0,4 per cent in the third quarter, with contractions in a number of countries, including France and Italy, and a slowdown in Germany. The Japanese economy shows signs of a sustained recovery, but growth moderated to 1,9 per cent in the third quarter, from around 4 per cent in the previous two quarters. The slowdown in emerging markets remains broad-based but there are signs that some countries, particularly in emerging Asia, may be responding to the recovery in the advanced economies. The outlook for China has also improved and it is expected to maintain its growth rate of around 7,5 per cent, amid recent moves towards further structural reforms. Subdued growth is expected in most of the larger Latin American economies, including Brazil and Mexico. Monetary policy in the advanced economies is expected to remain highly accommodative for some time against the backdrop of subdued headline and core inflation as well as persistently high rates of unemployment. Despite the expected reversal of quantitative easing, the US policy rate is expected to remain at the zero bound for much longer, while slow growth and the risk of deflation prompted the recent further easing of monetary policy by the ECB. Inflation in the UK has declined to below the upper threshold of 2,5 per cent. Emerging market economies are facing generally higher inflation dynamics, due in part to exchange rate reactions to expectations of Fed tapering. Inflation pressures have 5 prompted monetary policy responses in a number of countries including Brazil, India and Indonesia, who have all raised rates. Speculation regarding tapering has been the main driver of rand exchange rate volatility since the previous meeting of the MPC. The rand appreciated to around R9,55 against the US dollar following the September decision by the Fed to delay tapering, and then reached a level of around R10.45 following the November FOMC meeting when market expectations were for an earlier start to tapering. More recently the rand has appreciated somewhat as the expected timing was pushed back by the markets, and also in response to the SARS release of new trade data. The rand has depreciated by 17 per cent against the US dollar since the beginning of the year, and by 15 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The exchange rate of the rand remains an increasingly upside risk to the inflation outlook, notwithstanding the relatively slow pass-through to consumer prices to date. The challenge facing the MPC is not only to anticipate the timing and speed of Fed tapering, but also to try to assess the extent to which tapering is already priced into the exchange rate. There is a risk that, should there be a stronger or more disorderly response by the markets to actual Fed tapering, the reaction of the exchange rate could be more extreme. These developments have been reflected in the non-resident activity in the domestic bond and equity markets. In September and October, when 6 expectations of Fed tapering were modified, non-residents were net buyers of bonds to the value of R17 billion, more or less reversing the net sales that followed the initial reaction in May. Since early November, however, when risk aversion returned, net sales of bonds have amounted to R9,7 billion. At the same time, net sales of equities have amounted to R14,5 billion. Year to date, non- resident purchases of bonds and equities have totalled R12,8 billion and R4,8 billion respectively. A further risk is the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which makes the exchange rate more sensitive to possible capital flow slowdowns or reversals. In the second quarter of 2013 the deficit amounted to 6,5 per cent of GDP, and the published trade data suggest that a further deterioration of the trade account can be expected following the temporary collapse of motor vehicle exports and significantly higher imports in the third quarter. The actual outcome may be ameliorated to some extent by the recent inclusion by SARS of South Africa’s merchandise trade data with its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners in the trade statistics, made possible by the modernisation of the customs data collections systems. The new inclusive data have resulted in a significant adjustment to the trade statistics published by SARS. However, in compiling the balance of payments accounts in the past, the Bank made estimates of South Africa’s trade with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and 7 Swaziland, based on various sources. The historical trade data in the balance of payments accounts will be revised to account for the differences between the new data and our own previous estimates. These revisions will be published in the December Quarterly Bulletin on 3rd December, and may also result in minor revisions to the GDP data. Nevertheless, the underlying trend of the current account is not expected to change significantly. The domestic economic growth outlook remains fragile. Following a rebound of growth to an annualised 3,0 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, the third quarter outcome is expected to be significantly lower, and more in line with the 0,9 per cent recorded in the first quarter of this year. The Bank’s forecast for growth in 2013 has been revised down from 2,0 per cent to 1,9 per cent, while the forecasts for 2014 and 2015 have been revised down to 3,0 per cent and 3,4 per cent respectively, from 3,3 per cent and 3,6 per cent. This is consistent with the Bank’s composite leading business cycle indicator which continues to trend sideways, while the RMB/BER business confidence index at 43 points was more or less unchanged in the fourth quarter, indicative of a subdued outlook. The adverse third quarter growth outcome is largely due to a quarter-to-quarter contraction of 2,1 per cent in the manufacturing sector, in part a consequence of the protracted strikes that resulted in a 27,9 per cent decline in the production of motor vehicles, parts and accessories in that quarter. Reflecting these developments, the Kagiso PMI declined to 50,0 index points in September from 8 55,6 points in August, but recovered somewhat to 50,7 index points in October. Industrial action and safety related stoppages also impacted negatively on mining output, but despite negative growth in August and September, a positive quarter- to-quarter growth rate of 1,4 per cent was recorded. Encouragingly, the construction sector is showing signs of recovery with a generally steady upward trend in the value of real building plans passed, and the confidence of building contractors in the business confidence index increasing to its highest level in almost six years. The moderating trend in the growth of consumption expenditure by households that has been evident for some time appears to have continued into the third quarter. Retail trade sales recorded a quarter-to-quarter increase of only 0,4 per cent in that quarter, and a month-to-month contraction of 0,7 per cent in September, although wholesale trade was more robust. This is consistent with the FNB/BER consumer confidence index which had reached a 10 year low in the third quarter of 2013, with only a marginal improvement in the fourth quarter. The trends in credit extension are likely to constrain consumption expenditure in the short to medium term. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances measured 8,4 per cent in September, down from 9,0 per cent in August, while the quarterly growth rate was 5,3 per cent in the third quarter. There are clear indications of a sharp decline in lending to households. Twelve-month growth in 9 general loans to households, mostly unsecured lending, declined to 14,2 per cent in September, the lowest rate of growth since February 2010, while annualised growth over three months was 2,8 per cent. In August and September a contraction was recorded in this category. Growth in mortgage lending, at below 3 per cent, remained subdued despite a small acceleration in September, mainly driven by commercial mortgages. By contrast, instalment sale credit remained buoyant, while twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to companies increased to 10,6 per cent. Household consumption expenditure is, however, expected to be supported to some extent by wage trends. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was 7,9 per cent in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 7,6 per cent for 2012 as a whole. Although a number of these settlements are generally well below the initial demands, they are considerably above the upper band of the inflation target, and pose a potential risk to the inflation outlook. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa, the official unemployment rate moderated to 24,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, from 25,5 per cent a year earlier. This follows an increase in employment of 2,8 per cent or 383,000 jobs over that period. This implies that the economy has only now returned to the same levels of employment attained before the crisis. These figures, however, are in contrast to the Quarterly Employment 10 Statistics of StatsSA which showed a 0,1 per cent growth in the formal non- agricultural sector from June 2012 to June 2013, and which correlates more closely with GDP trends. Fiscal policy, as outlined in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, continues to be countercyclical, attempting to balance the need to support the economy and the need for fiscal consolidation. A deficit of 4,2 per cent is projected for the current fiscal year, and is expected to narrow to 3,0 per cent by 2015/16. Non-interest real expenditure growth is capped at an average of 2,2 per cent over the next three years, and the three-year agreement with civil service unions, due to expire in 2015, is expected to limit the growth in the public sector wage bill. This pace of consolidation should stabilise the net national debt at 44 per cent in 2017/18. Food price inflation moderated to 4,2 per cent in October, from 6,0 per cent in September, with the deceleration in price increases being broad-based. Final manufactured producer food price inflation declined from 7,5 per cent peak in July to 6,8 per cent in September. Agricultural product prices increased by 4,3 per cent at the producer price level in September, with cereals and other crop prices declining by 6,8 per cent. This was in line with lower international food commodity prices, which offset the impact of the weaker exchange rate to some extent. While food price inflation may continue to moderate in the short term, 11 upside pressures can be expected from the exchange rate and the fact that meat price declines, due in part by drought-induced culling, are unlikely to persist. International oil prices have remained relatively contained below the US dollar 110 per barrel level since the previous MPC meeting. These prices continue to be dominated by political developments in the Middle East, and the global growth outlook. Should international oil prices and the exchange rate remain at current levels, a small increase in the domestic petrol price is likely in December following a cumulative 48 cents decrease in October and November. It is important to note, however, that further weakness in the exchange rate will pass through quickly into these prices. Despite the better-than-expected October inflation outcome, the Monetary Policy Committee continues to assess the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, mainly as a result of further potential exchange rate pressures. Tapering by the Fed is inevitable, but until a decision is taken financial markets globally are likely to experience heightened volatility. There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which US policy actions are already priced in to the exchange rate. Compounding the risks to the exchange rate is the stubbornly wide current account deficit, notwithstanding recent revisions to the trade data. The deficit increases South Africa’s sensitivity to global spillover effects. The MPC is mindful 12 of the adjustment lags and will be watching carefully for signs of a positive current account response. We need to take advantage of the depreciated exchange rate and not allow the benefits to be eroded through higher wage and other input prices. Action will be required should the adjustment mechanism not operate effectively. While the exchange rate impact on CPI is increasingly evident in the core inflation measure, to date the pass-through has been relatively muted. But this is unlikely to persist should there be a significant further depreciation. At the same time the policy dilemma is underlined by the deterioration in the growth outlook. The committee assesses the risks to be on the downside, amid continued supply disruptions and low business and consumer confidence. The downward trend of household consumption expenditure is indicative of relatively weak demand conditions in the economy, and slower bank credit extension to households is likely to reinforce this trend. The inflation forecast remains uncomfortably close to the upper level of the inflation target range but our central forecast remains within the target. Given the increased upside risks to the outlook, we do not see room for further monetary accommodation. We will continue to monitor developments carefully on an ongoing basis and remain committed to act as required. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum at this stage.

19 September 2013 

South African Reserve Bank STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), domestic inflation has breached the upper end of the target range. This development was in line with our forecast and we continue to expect inflation to moderate somewhat in the final quarter of this year. While the outlook for the domestic economic growth environment remains unchanged, it has been overshadowed by protracted work stoppages. Where wage agreements have been reached, these have generally been above the headline inflation rate, contributing to the upside risk to the inflation outlook. During this period, global financial markets have been dominated by continued speculation about the speed and timing of tapering of quantitative easing by the 2 US Fed. The uncertainty related to this event resulted in a high degree of volatility and weakening in a number of emerging market economies foreign exchange and bond markets since May. The decision by the Fed to delay tapering surprised the markets, and emerging market currencies in particular responded strongly with many seeing significant overnight currency appreciation. The Fed emphasised the data dependent nature of its decision, indicating that this respite could prove to be temporary, as speculation regarding the timing of future tapering is likely to continue whenever positive data emerges from the US. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 6,3 per cent in July and 6,4 per cent in August. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation measured 7,1 per cent in August, up from 6,8 per cent in July, while petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 23 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,1 per cent, down from 5,2 per cent in July, while administered prices excluding petrol moderated to 7,0 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods accelerated to 6,6 per cent in July, up from 5,9 per cent in June. The inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated further since the previous meeting of the MPC. The forecast for 2013 is unchanged at an average of 5,9 per cent, but inflation is now expected to average 5,8 per cent in 2014 compared with 5,5 per cent in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2015 has been raised from 3 5,2 per cent to 5,4 per cent, and inflation is expected to average 5,3 per cent in the final two quarters of that year. The current breach of the inflation target is still expected to be temporary, and the peak was possibly reached in August. The deterioration in the forecast is mainly due to changes in assumptions related to the exchange rate of the rand and petrol prices, but given the overnight developments these assumptions will be revisited on an ongoing basis. The forecast for core inflation for 2013 is 0,1 percentage point lower, at an average of 5,2 per cent. This measure is then expected to average 5,4 per cent and 5,3 per cent in the coming two years, compared with the previous forecasts of 5,2 per cent and 5,0 per cent respectively, and to measure 5,1 per cent in the final quarter of 2015. This upward drift of underlying inflation is due to the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate and the impact of higher unit labour costs. Inflation expectations, as measured in the survey conducted in the third quarter of 2013 by the Bureau for Economic Research, have remained stable around the upper end of the target range. It is of concern to the MPC that inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2013 and 6,2 per cent and 6,1 per cent in the subsequent two years respectively. Business respondents expect inflation to average 6,4 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, slightly lower than in the previous forecast, while expectations of trade unionists are unchanged from the previous survey, at 6,2 per cent and 6,3 per cent for these respective years. The 4 expectations of economic analysts have deteriorated slightly since the previous survey but still expect inflation to average below 6,0 per cent over the period, and to average 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Global economic prospects have improved in a number of the advanced economies, but downside risks remain. Growth in the US appears to be gradually improving, despite fiscal headwinds, and most forecasts are for growth in excess of 2,5 per cent in 2014. There are, however, a number of downside risks to the outlook which were also highlighted by the Fed. Financial conditions have tightened since the initial tapering announcement, and there are fears that the significantly higher mortgage rates and the observed downturn in mortgage applications could derail the nascent recovery in the housing market, posing a risk to household consumption expenditure. Fiscal policy is also seen as a source of downside risk, with the debt ceiling issue expected to resurface in mid- October. Failure to find resolution could result in further unplanned fiscal expenditure cuts. The Eurozone emerged from its protracted recession in the second quarter of 2013 led by Germany, but economic growth is expected to remain weak and below trend for some time. This negative outlook is compounded by fragile political environments in a number of countries, including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of the peripheral countries to meet the conditions of their bail- out clauses amid stringent fiscal consolidation measures and deteriorating debt 5 dynamics, and slow progress towards a banking union. The Japanese economy appears to be responding to the stimulus packages and the weaker yen, but it is still too early to assess the sustainability of the recovery. Fears of a marked slowdown in China have abated somewhat following strong growth in industrial production in August, amidst easing liquidity and bank lending conditions. While there are some concerns that the recent improvement is based on an unsustainable credit boom, growth in excess of 7 per cent in 2014 is generally expected. The expectation of an end to US quantitative easing prompted a sell-off of emerging market assets, which has the risk of further undermining the weaker growth outlook that has been apparent for some time. While financial markets in these countries have reacted positively to the Fed’s decision not to begin tapering at this stage, the underlying weaknesses are expected to persist. Monetary policy in the advanced economies remains highly accommodative, and forward guidance suggests that low policy rates will be maintained for some time. Inflation in the advanced economies remains very low but there is speculation that a faster-than-expected decline in the US unemployment rate could prompt an earlier start to normalisation of monetary policy in the US. Some emerging markets, notably Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey and India have either tightened monetary policy in response to currency depreciation, implemented a range of 6 direct controls on capital flows or engaged in direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate of the rand has been highly volatile since the previous meeting of the MPC, against the backdrop of a widening current account deficit, domestic labour disputes, and the reversal of capital flows to emerging market economies. The rand’s strong co-movement with other emerging market currencies suggests that external factors predominated over this period. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand has fluctuated in a range between around R9,55 and R10,50 against the US dollar and appreciated by 2,3 per cent against the dollar, but is more or less unchanged on a trade weighted basis. The uncertainties related to possible changes in US monetary policy have been reflected in the volatile non-resident activity in the domestic bond and equity markets. Following net sales of domestic bonds to the value of R17,9 bn between May and August in reaction to the Fed tapering announcement, non-residents have been net purchasers of bonds in September to the value of R9,3 bn, bringing the cumulative total since the beginning of the year to R14,9 bn. Non- resident appetite for domestic equities has remained strong following net sales in 2011 and 2012, with year-to-date net purchases of R28,3 bn. The risks to the inflation outlook from the exchange rate remain elevated and dependent on its future trend. A sustained depreciation trend could pose a 7 significant risk to the inflation outcome. While there are some signs of generalised price pressures evident in the producer price index, to date the pass- through to consumer price inflation has been relatively muted, given the weak pricing power in the current low growth environment. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to global sentiment as well as to the current account deficit, which widened to 6,5 per cent of GDP in the second quarter of 2013. The deficit is expected to narrow in the coming months in response to the depreciated currency. However, this response is expected to be slow, given the import-intensive nature of capital expenditure by the state-owned enterprises in particular. Furthermore, export revenues are hampered by weak external demand, strike activity in the mining and motor vehicles sectors in particular, and declining terms of trade. The stepping up of exports is critical to address the current account deficit. While the rand has appreciated significantly in the last few days, the experience of the past few months is indicative of its vulnerability to future changes in US monetary policy. The domestic growth outlook is unchanged since the previous MPC meeting. The real GDP growth rate of 3,0 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2013 was driven mainly by a recovery in the manufacturing sector, following the marked contraction in the first quarter. Despite the rebound, growth was below the estimated potential of around 3,5 per cent and the negative output gap widened further. The Bank’s forecast of GDP growth is unchanged: we still expect growth 8 to average 2,0 per cent in 2013, and 3,3 per cent and 3,6 per cent in the next two years respectively. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank declined slightly in June, continuing its broadly sideways movement, confirming the subdued growth outlook. Business sentiment remains weak: the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined from 48 index points in the second quarter to 42 index points in the third quarter. There are, however, tentative signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector. The Kagiso PMI increased to its highest level in 6 years, and in July the physical volume of manufacturing production increased by 3,5 per cent on a month-to- month basis, and 5,4 per cent year-on-year. Capacity utilisation also increased marginally in the second quarter of 2013 to 81,3 per cent. Despite these positive trends, manufacturing output is expected to be adversely affected by protracted strikes, particularly in the motor vehicle sector. Mining output, which contracted in the second quarter, is expected to contribute positively to growth in the third quarter, following strong increases in production in July and a relatively quick resolution of the strikes in the gold mining sector. Growth in real gross fixed capital formation remains relatively weak, at an annualised rate of 2,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2013. A positive feature is the acceleration in the growth of private sector fixed investment expenditure to 4,4 per cent, which more than offset the decline in outlays by the public corporations, mainly due to unplanned construction delays. Gross fixed capital 9 formation as a percentage of GDP increased marginally to 19,5 per cent in the second quarter, still well below the levels of around 24 per cent reached in 2008 and the National Development Plan target of 30 per cent by 2030. Employment trends remain extremely subdued, consistent with the slow pace of economic growth. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) of Stats SA, formal non-agricultural employment increased by a mere 7,000 employees or 0,1 per cent between the quarters ended June 2012 and June 2013. Of great concern is the loss of jobs in the tradeable sectors of the economy. Over this period there was a loss of 23,000 employees in the mining sector and a total of 7,000 in the manufacturing and construction sectors, while there was an increase of 26,000 employees in the community, social and personal services industry. Growth in final consumption expenditure by households has been on a declining trend since the first quarter of 2012, but may have bottomed out, having increased from 2,3 per cent in the first quarter to 2,5 per cent in the second quarter. There was a notable increase in the consumption of durable goods, which could include pre-emptive buying ahead of possible exchange rate-induced price increases, as reflected in the sharp decline in new vehicle sales in August. The moderate trend in consumer demand is also reflected in the 2,8 per cent year-to-year increase in retail trade sales in July, and the month-on-month decline of 0,5 per cent. 10 The FNB/BER Consumer confidence index increased significantly in the third quarter and expenditure is expected to be positively affected by high wage settlements and positive wealth effects. Nevertheless consumption expenditure growth is expected to be constrained by low employment creation, high household debt levels, declining rates of credit extension to households, and high petrol and electricity price increases, all of which are likely to curtail discretionary spending. The trend of wage settlements remains an upside risk to inflation and job creation. The current wage bargaining round has seen a wide range of settlements, generally above the current inflation rate. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was 7,9 per cent in the first half of 2013 and this is likely to have increased in the third quarter. According to data derived from the QES, average salary and wages per worker over four quarters increased by 8,7 per cent in the quarter ending June 2013, but when accounting for productivity increases, the unit labour cost increase amounted to 6,8 per cent. The ultimate impact on inflation will depend in part on the increase in the total wage bill, as the impact of higher wages may be offset by job losses or slower employment creation. We are concerned that the increase in productivity, although relatively low, reflects job losses and a switch to more capital intensive production. 11 The moderate pace of bank credit extension to the private sector has been maintained with twelve-month growth of 8,7 per cent in total loans and advances recorded in July. Installment sale credit and leasing finance remained robust, while growth in general loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, declined to 20,2 per cent in July, the lowest rate of growth since August 2010. The shorter term trends for unsecured lending are more marked, with growth in the three months to July measuring 11,0 per cent and negative growth in loans of less than R30,000. Growth in mortgage credit extension has remained subdued. Twelve-month growth in credit extension to the corporate sector declined from 10,5 per cent in June to 8,7 per cent in July, with some indications that this reflects a lack of demand by corporates. They remain relatively cash flush and have also placed increasing reliance on corporate bond issues Food prices are a risk to the inflation outlook, although the continued downward trend of international food prices has helped to offset the impact of the weaker rand on maize and wheat prices. Consumer food inflation measured 7,4 per cent in August, while at the producer price level, manufactured food price inflation measured 7,5 per cent in July. Price increases of agricultural products, by contrast, were muted at 0,5 per cent in July, with year-on-year declines in the prices of cereals and meat, but strong increases, of 21,4 per cent, in fruit and vegetable prices. 12 The immediate risks to inflation from international crude oil prices appear to have abated for now following a decline in the political risk premium, but prices remain highly sensitive to developments in the Middle East in particular. Having increased to a level of around US dollar 118 per barrel in response to events in Egypt and Syria, the price has since moderated to around US dollar 110 as the risk of US military action in Syria has subsided. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 23,0 per cent in August, but favourable base effects and the small decline in the price in September are likely to result in a far lower rate of petrol price inflation in that month. The combination of a lower oil price and a stronger exchange rate observed in recent days is likely to result in a further moderate price decline in October, reversing the expectation earlier in the month of a further significant increase. The Monetary Policy Committee assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, mainly due to exchange rate and wage pressures. The decision of the Fed to delay tapering has provided a temporary reprieve to the exchange rate. However, the continued uncertainty relating to the timing of the inevitable slowdown in bond purchases and its data dependent nature, imply that emerging market currencies, including the rand, are likely to experience a protracted period of volatility. In the short run these developments may have moderated the risk to inflation from the exchange rate, but medium to longer term risks remain, which will be assessed on an ongoing basis 13 The MPC remains mindful of the conflicting policy choices that it faces. The breach of the upper end of the inflation target is expected to be temporary, but the longer term trajectory is uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. At the same time, there are still no significant demand side pressures in the economy and consumption expenditure growth is subdued. The output gap continues to widen, and the employment data show that there is very little net employment creation in the economy, while employment in the manufacturing and mining sectors has been declining. Consumers remain under pressure with persistently high debt to disposable income ratios, further exacerbated by the rising cost of petrol and other administered prices. Currently, a sustained breach of the inflation target is not our central forecast, but the upside risks to the inflation outlook require careful monitoring. Should the risks to the medium-term inflation outlook deteriorate significantly the MPC will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to maintain the integrity of the inflation targeting framework and to anchor inflation expectations at a lower level. At this stage, however, given the global uncertainties and downside growth risks, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum.
